Introduction
------------

The official Arch Linux IRC channel is #archlinux on the Freenode
network.

There are also a number of other channels dedicated to Arch Linux
maintained by community members. See IRC channels for a listing.

> Usage

To join the channels, you need an irc client. Wikipedia has a list of
irc clients. The following commands can be used inside your IRC client
to connect to a server and join a channel:

    /connect chat.freenode.net
    /join #archlinux

#archlinux - The official support channel
-----------------------------------------

This is the main channel. The central topic for the channel is support
and general discussion about Arch Linux.

The channel is currently +q $~a. This means that you have to register
and identify with the NickServ service before you can talk in the
channel. After you have connected to chat.freenode.net, use the
following commands for help getting all set up with NickServ:

    /query nickserv help register
    /query nickserv help identify

-   Client settings and bots
    -   If you want to bring a bot into the channel, then ask an
        operator before you do so.
    -   Auto-response in channel or in pm is not allowed (the only
        exception is 'away' responses at nick highlight in pm).
-   Channelbot usage
    -   There is only one official channel bot. 'phrik
        n=archbot@archlinux/bot/phrik'
    -   Try to limit the bot usage in channel. Remember, you can '/query
        phrik' when the output is not needed in-channel.
    -   No spamming of bot commands
-   Advertising
    -   Advertising is not allowed unless an op has given you permission
        to do so.
-   Content/links
    -   The main topic of the channel is support for and discussion
        about Arch Linux.
    -   Talk about general software and hardware is allowed if it does
        not interfere with the main topic of the channel.
    -   Anything that is not covered by the previous statements is
        handled on a case-by-case basis at the op's discretion.

> #archlinux guidelines

1.  The language of the channel is English. If you need help in another
    language, search international arch channels.
2.  Read the /topic on a regular basis. It often contains important
    information.
3.  Do not participate in flamewars, instantly report violators and
    trolls to channel operators.
4.  Do not spam the channel, use a pastebin to share something longer
    than three lines. program &> program-output.txt in combination with
    pastebin clients can ease this step.
5.  Do not abuse phrik (the channel bot). If you want to try out
    commands or look trough the help function, then do it in a /query or
    /msg. Example: /query phrik help <command>.
6.  Do not ask whether anyone is alive or uses your software, just state
    your question.
7.  Ask smart questions. It is easier for us to help you when you ask
    good/smart questions.
8.  Do not demand help, ask for it. Wait for a few minutes before
    restating questions. Most questions get answered by 'just another
    user', like you.
9.  Do not be shy, feel free to help others, every user has something to
    contribute. The channel is a community effort to provide support,
    and depends on volunteers.
10. Help yourself before you ask. Use wiki search, use forum search,
    read man pages and try Google. This method will often get you an
    answer faster, and will teach you more.
11. When asking for help, always reply to people that ask you for more
    information, if you do not know the answer then say so.
12. Set a good example. Each user's behavior affects all users in the
    channel. Be friendly and polite to maintain a pleasant and
    professional climate.

-   Ops can kick people entirely at their own discretion, do not be a
    moron. If you think an op acted unfairly, bring it up.
