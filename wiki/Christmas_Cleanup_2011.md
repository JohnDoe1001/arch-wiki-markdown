E-mail invitation
-----------------

    Season's greetings,

    As December the 13th is approaching, I would like to extend a hand, to
    invite you all to a Christmas cleaning of our packages.

    As you may, or may not know, December the 13th is the longest night of
    the year, at least it were said to be so, before the Gregorian
    calender was introduced.
    If everything is not ready before Christmas, a group of restless dead
    souls will come at night and vandalize your property. [1] [2]


    Also, the 13th of December is the date for several highly memorable
    events, which contributes to making it an appropriate date for a
    deadline for adopting orphans in [community] (before moving them to
    unsupported the 14th):

    * Pope Celestine V resigned the papacy, 13th of December 1294, after
    only five months. He was the third pope in history to resign
    voluntarily. Benedict IX resigned in May 1040, but soon regretted it,
    and returned to papacy. The reason for Pope Celestine V to resign was
    to hope to return to his previous life as an ascetic hermit. [3]

    * Malta became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, the 13th
    of December 1974. This occasion is marked every year as Republic Day
    (Maltese: Jum ir-Repubblika). [4]

    * Erik XIV, king of Sweden and ruler of Estonia was born, the 13th of
    December 1533. Unfortunately, he got mentally ill at the end of eight
    year of rule and was murdered, probably with arsenic. [5]

    * Robert Plot, the author of "Natural History of Staffordshire", was
    born the 13th of December 1640. He was the first man to describe the
    Abbots Bromley Horn Dance, an English folk dance involving reindeer
    antlers and a hobby horse. The event takes place each year in Abbots
    Bromley, a small village in Staffordshire, England. [6] [7]

    * Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, the first man to apply mathematics to the
    investigation of the paths of cannonballs, died the 13th of December
    1557. His work was later validated by Galileo's studies on falling
    bodies. [8]

    * Ana Justina Ferreira Néri, considered to be the first Brazilian
    nurse, were born the 13th of December 1814. [9]


    With this freshly in mind, I hope there remains no doubt that this is
    the perfect date to gather up all the orphans for a big package
    cleanup.

    After the 13th of December (the 14th of December, then), we (TU's)
    will move all packages that are still orphans from [community] to
    unsupported (AUR). Maintaining [community] and unsupported are part of
    our mission. [10]

    For maintainers everywhere, giving extra care and attention to
    packages that are merely flagged is also looked upon with good favor,
    of course. That also goes for deleting or orphaning AUR packages that
    hasn't been working for a while (say, for the last 6 months).

    I hope you're all with me on this, and that we can stand together, as
    one, to move all orphans to unsupported and shed some dead weight from
    AUR.

    I'll end this with two perfectly suitable and hand-picked inspirational quotes:

    "Knowing is not enough; we must apply.
    Willing is not enough; we must do."
    - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

    "The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond
    them into the impossible."
    - Arthur C. Clarke

    Happy Saint Lucy's Day,

Valid reasons for keeping orphans in community are:

  Reason   Description
  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  dep      Dependency or optional dependency for a package in core/extra/community/multilib
  imp      Too important for Arch Linux as a whole to move to unsupported (this is subjective, use good judgement)
  ess      Essential for users of some languages (that typically isn't English)
  mak      Make dependency for a package in core/extra/community/multilib

> Table of maintainers of packages that depend on one or more of the above orphans

These are also good suggestions for which maintainers might consider to
adopt which orphans.

¤ = needs to be removed from svn as well

Conclusion
----------

    Hi,

    The Christmas Cleanup became a success. Thanks to everybody
    that has contributed by adopting packages, editing the wiki page or
    giving suggestions for specific packages and how they should be
    handled.

    * At least 9 packages in [community] that were previously orphans have now been adopted.
    * 94 orphans have been moved to unsupported (AUR)
    * 61 orphans will be kept in [community] (hopefully they will be adopted later on)
    * 18 maintainers are being encouraged to adopt the orphans which their packages depend on

    Thanks. :)

    Warm wishes,
