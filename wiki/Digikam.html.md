Digikam
=======

Digikam is a KDE-based image organizer with built-in editing features
via a plugin architecture.

Installation
------------

Digikam can be installed with the package digikam, available in the
official repositories.

Optionally, install kdemultimedia-mplayerthumbs to generate thumbnails
for video files.

Troubleshooting
---------------

> Video playback

As a Phonon backend will have been installed as a dependency of Digikam,
multimedia codecs for the backend may be missing. If you are using the
phonon-gstreamer backend, try installing one or more of its plugins with
pacman -S gstreamer0.10-{good,bad,ugly,ffmpeg} .
