Disk Partitions
---------------

The factory default partition table is a mess and the Arch Linux
installation programm has troubles with it. I booted an ubuntu
installation CD and partitioned the drive with that, then cancelled the
installation and continued with Arch Linux. I think parted or gparted
does the trick, so you can use any Linux live CD with it.

Graphics Card / X11
-------------------

See Intel Graphics.

WiFi / Wlan Network
-------------------

See Wireless Setup#ath5k

Brightness Control
------------------

To control the brightness of the display, modprobe video (the ACPI video
module), via /etc/rc.conf. Then you have
/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness. Use

    cat < /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness

to get maximum brightness.
