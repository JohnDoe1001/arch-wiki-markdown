Installation
------------

Install the logmein-hamachi package from the AUR.

Configuration
-------------

> Hamachi 2 (beta)

Hamachi 2 is configured in
/var/lib/logmein-hamachi/h2-engine-override.cfg (create that file if it
doesn't exist). Unfortunately, it isn't easy to find a comprehensive
list of possible configuration options, so here are a few that you can
use.

Using the hamachi command line tool as a regular user

In order to use the hamachi command line tool as a regular user, add the
following line to the configuration file:

    Ipc.User YourUserNameHere

Automatically setting a custom nickname

Normally, Hamachi uses your system's hostname as the nickname that other
Hamachi users will see. If you want to automatically set a custom
nickname every time Hamachi starts, add the following line to the
configuration file:

    Setup.AutoNick YourNicknameHere

You can also manually set a nickname using the hamachi command line
tool:

    # hamachi set-nick YourNicknameHere

However, this needs to be done every time Hamachi is (re-)started, so if
you always want to use the same nickname, setting it automatically (as
explained above) is probably easier.

Running Hamachi
---------------

    # systemctl start logmein-hamachi

Now you have a whole bunch of commands at your disposal. These are in no
particular order and are fairly self explanatory.

    $hamachi set-nick bob
    $hamachi login
    $hamachi create my-net secretpassword
    $hamachi go-online my-net
    $hamachi list
    $hamachi go-offline my-net

To get a list of all the commands, run:

    $hamachiÂ ?

Note:Make sure you change the status of the channel(s) you are in to
"online" if you want to perform any network actions on computers in
there.

> Systemd

The logmein-hamachi AUR package also includes a nice little Systemd
daemon.

If you feel like it, you can set Hamachi to start at every boot with
Systemd:

    # systemctl enable logmein-hamachi

To start the Hamachi Daemon immediately, use this command:

    # systemctl start logmein-hamachi

---

The following GUI frontends for Hamachi are available in the AUR:
