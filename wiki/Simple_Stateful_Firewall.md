Simple Stateful Firewall
========================

This page explains how to set up a stateful firewall using iptables. It
also explains what the rules mean and why they are needed. For
simplicity, it is split into two major sections. The first section deals
with a firewall for a single machine, the second sets up a NAT gateway
in addition to the firewall from the first section.

Warning: The rules are given in the order that they are executed. If you
are logged into a remote machine, you may be locked out of the machine
while setting up the rules. You should only follow the steps below while
you are logged in locally.

The example config file can be used to get around this problem.

Prerequisites
-------------

Note: Your kernel needs to be compiled with iptables support. All stock
Arch Linux kernels have iptables support.

First, install the userland utilities:

    # pacman -S iptables

This HOWTO assumes that there are currently no iptables rules set. To
check this, try the command

    # iptables-save

If not, you can reset the rules by loading a default rule set:

    # iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/empty.rules

Firewall for a single machine
-----------------------------

Note:Because iptables processes rules in linear order, from top to
bottom within a chain, it is advised to put frequently-hit rules near
the start of the chain. Of course there is a limit, depending on the
logic that is being implemented. Also, rules have an associated runtime
cost, so rules should not be reordered solely based upon empirical
observations of the byte/packet counters.

> Creating necessary chains

For this basic setup, we will create two user-defined chains that we
will use to open up ports in the firewall.

    # iptables -N TCP
    # iptables -N UDP

> The FORWARD chain

If you want to set up your machine as a NAT gateway, please look at the
second section of this HOWTO. For a single machine, however, we simply
set the policy of the FORWARD chain to DROP and move on:

    # iptables -P FORWARD DROP

> The OUTPUT chain

We have no intention of filtering any outgoing traffic, as this would
make the setup much more complicated and would require some extra
thought. In this simple case, we set the OUTPUT policy to ACCEPT.

    # iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

> The INPUT chain

First, we set the default policy for the INPUT chain to DROP in case
something somehow slips by our rules. Dropping all traffic and
specifying what is allowed is the best way to make a secure firewall.

Warning:This is the step where you will be locked out if you are in
logged via ssh. Therefore do this step following your rule regarding
port 22 (or whatever port you're using for SSH) to prevent being locked
out.

    # iptables -P INPUT DROP

Every packet that is received by any network interface will pass the
INPUT chain first, if it is destined for this machine. In this chain, we
make sure that only the packets that we want are accepted.

The first rule will allow traffic that belongs to established
connections, or new valid traffic that is related to these connections
such as ICMP errors, or echo replies (the packets a host returns when
pinged). ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. Some ICMP
messages are very important and help to manage congestion and MTU, and
are accepted by this rule.

    # iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

The second rule will accept all traffic from the "loopback" (lo)
interface, which is necessary for many applications and services.

Note:You can add more trusted interfaces here such as "eth1" if you do
not want/need the traffic filtered by the firewall, but be warned that
if you have a NAT setup that redirects any kind of traffic to this
interface from anywhere else in the network (let's say a router), it'll
get through, regardless of any other settings you may have.

    # iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

The third rule will drop all traffic with an "INVALID" state match.
Traffic can fall into four "state" categories: NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED
or INVALID and this is what makes this a "stateful" firewall rather than
a less secure "stateless" one. States are tracked using the
"nf_conntrack_*" kernel modules which are loaded automatically by the
kernel as you add rules.

Note:This rule will drop all packets with invalid headers or checksums,
invalid TCP flags, invalid ICMP messages (such as a port unreachable
when we did not send anything to the host), and out of sequence packets
which can be caused by sequence prediction or other similar attacks. The
"DROP" target will drop a packet without any response, contrary to
REJECT which politely refuses the packet. We use DROP because there is
no proper "REJECT" response to packets that are INVALID, and we do not
want to acknowledge that we received these packets.

Note:ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets remain untracked, and will always
be classified "INVALID" though they are not corrupted or thelike. Keep
this in mind, and accept them before this rule! iptables -A INPUT -p 41
-j ACCEPT

    # iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP

The next rule will accept all new incoming ICMP echo requests, also
known as pings. Only the first packet will count as NEW, the rest will
be handled by the RELATED,ESTABLISHED rule. Since the computer is not a
router, no other ICMP traffic with state NEW should needs to be allowed.

    # iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

Now we append the OPEN chains to INPUT chain to handle all new incoming
connections. Once a connection is accepted by the OPEN chains, it is
handled by the RELATED/ESTABLISHED traffic rule. The OPEN chains will
either accept new incoming connections, or politely reject them. New TCP
connections must be started with SYN packets.

Note: NEW but not SYN is the only invalid TCP flag not covered by the
INVALID state. The reason is because they are rarely malicious packets,
and they should not just be dropped. Instead, we simply do not accept
them, so they are rejected with a TCP RST by the next rule.

    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j UDP
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j TCP

We reject TCP connections with TCP RST packets and UDP streams with ICMP
port unreachable messages if the ports are not opened. This imitates
default Linux behavior (RFC compliant), and it allows the sender to
quickly close the connection and clean up.

    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-rst

For other protocols, we add a final rule to the INPUT chain to reject
all remaining incoming traffic with icmp protocol unreachable messages.
This imitates Linux's default behavior.

    # iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable

> Example iptables.rules file

Example of iptables.rules file after running all the commands from
above:

This file is generated with:

    iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules 

and can be used to prevent blocking yourself out if you are setting up
the firewall remotely, just remember to append:

    -A TCP -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

which will allow ssh in. (Assuming ssh on port 22)

> The OPEN chains

The OPEN chains contain rules for accepting new incoming TCP connections
and UDP streams to specific ports.

Note:This is where you need to add rules to accept incoming connections,
such as SSH, HTTP or other services that you want to access remotely.

Opening ports to incoming connections

To accept incoming TCP connections on port 80 for a web server:

    # iptables -A TCP -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

To accept incoming TCP connections on port 443 for a web server (HTTPS):

    # iptables -A TCP -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

To allow remote SSH connections (on port 22):

    # iptables -A TCP -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

To accept incoming UDP streams on port 53 for a DNS server:

    # iptables -A UDP -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

See `man iptables` for more advanced rules, like matching multiple
ports.

Port Knocking

(xtables-addons ships with xt_pknock which does not require an extra
daemon.)

knockd is a port knocking daemon that can provide an added layer of
security to your network. The knockd wiki provides three example port
knocking configurations. These configs can be easily altered to
intergrate properly with firewall described here. You should simply
substitue the INPUT chain specification, with the custom open chain used
in the firewall.

For example:

     [options]
           logfile = /var/log/knockd.log
     [opencloseSSH]
           sequence      = 2222:udp,3333:tcp,4444:udp
           seq_timeout   = 15
           tcpflags      = syn,ack
           start_command = /usr/sbin/iptables -A TCP -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
           cmd_timeout   = 10
           stop_command  = /usr/sbin/iptables -D TCP -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

It is wise to randomly select the ports that you use for the knock
sequence. random.org can help you generate a selection of ports between
1 and 65535. To check that you have not inadvertantly selected commonly
used ports, use this port database, and/or your /etc/services file.

> Protection against spoofing attacks

Blocking reserved local addresses incoming from the internet or local
network is normally done through setting the rp_filter sysctl to 1. To
do so, add the following line to your /etc/sysctl.conf to enable source
address verification which is built into Linux kernel itself. The
verification by the kernel will handle spoofing better than individual
iptables rules for each case.

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1

Only when asynchronous routing and/or rp_filter=0 is used, need extra
checks be used:

    # iptables -I INPUT ! -i lo -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j DROP

> "Hide" your computer

If you are running a desktop machine, it might be a good idea to block
some incoming requests.

Block Ping Request

A 'Ping' request is an ICMP packet sent to the destination address to
ensure connectivity between the devices. If your network works well, you
can safely block all ping requests. It is important to note that this
does not actually hide your computer — any packet sent to you is
rejected, so you will still show up in a simple nmap "ping scan" of an
IP range.

This is rudimentary "protection" and makes life difficult when debugging
issues in the future. You should only do this for education purposes.

To block echo requests, add the following line to your /etc/sysctl.conf
file:

    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1

Rate-limiting is a better way to control possible abuse. This first
method implements a global limit (ie, only X packets per minute for all
source addresses):

    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 30/min --limit-burst 8 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP

Or using the 'recent' module, you can impose a limit per source address:

    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m recent --name ping_limiter --set
    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m recent --name ping_limiter --update --hitcount 6 --seconds 4 -j DROP
    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT

If you choose to use either the rate limiting or the source limiting
rules the PING rule that already exists in the INPUT chain needs to be
deleted. This can be done as shown below, or alternatively don't use it
in the first place.

    # iptables -D INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

Next you need to decide where you wish to place the rate limiting or
source limiting rules. If you place the rules below the
RELATED,ESTABLISHED rule then you will be counting and limiting new ping
connections, not each ping sent to your machine. If you place them
before the RELATED,ESTABLISHED rule then these rules will count and
limit each ping sent to your machine, not each ping connection made.

More information is in the iptables man page, or reading the docs and
examples on the webpage http://snowman.net/projects/ipt_recent/

Tricking port scanners

Note:This opens you up to a form of DoS. An attack can send packets with
spoofed IPs and get them blocked from connecting to your services.

Port scans are used by attackers to identify open ports on your
computer. This allows them to identify and fingerprint your running
services and possibly launch exploits against them.

The INVALID state rule will take care of every type of port scan except
UDP, ACK and SYN scans (-sU, -sA and -sS in nmap respectively).

ACK scans are not used to identify open ports, but to identify ports
filtered by a firewall. Due to the SYN check for all TCP connections
with the state NEW, every single packet sent by an ACK scan will be
correctly rejected by a TCP RST packet. Some firewalls drop these
packets instead, and this allows an attacker to map out the firewall
rules.

The recent module can be used to trick the remaining two types of port
scans. The recent module is used to add hosts to a "recent" list which
can be used to fingerprint and stop certain types of attacks. Current
recent lists can be viewed in /proc/net/xt_recent/.

SYN scans

In a SYN scan, the port scanner sends SYN packet to every port. Closed
ports return a TCP RST packet, or get dropped by a strict firewall. Open
ports return a SYN ACK packet regardless of the presence of a firewall.

The recent module can be used to keep track of hosts with rejected
connection attempts and return a TCP RST for any SYN packet they send to
open ports as if the port was closed. If an open port is the first to be
scanned, a SYN ACK will still be returned, so running applications such
as ssh on non-standard ports is required for this to work consistently.

First, insert a rule at the top of the TCP chain. This rule responds
with a TCP RST to any host that got onto the TCP-PORTSCAN list in the
past sixty seconds. The --update switch causes the recent list to be
updated, meaning the 60 second counter is reset.

    # iptables -I TCP -p tcp -m recent --update --seconds 60 --name TCP-PORTSCAN -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-rst

Next, the rule for rejecting TCP packets need to be modified to add
hosts with rejected packets to the TCP-PORTSCAN list.

    # iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-rst
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m recent --set --name TCP-PORTSCAN -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-rst

UDP scans

UDP port scans are similar to TCP SYN scans except that UDP is a
"connectionless" protocol. There are no handshakes or acknowledgements.
Instead, the scanner sends UDP packets to each UDP port. Closed ports
should return ICMP port unreachable messages, and open ports do not
return a response. Since UDP is not a "reliable" protocol, the scanner
has no way of knowing if packets were lost, and has to do multiple
checks for each port that does not return a response.

The Linux kernel sends out ICMP port unreachable messages very slowly,
so a full UDP scan against a Linux machine would take over 10 hours.
However, common ports could still be identified, so applying the same
countermeasures against UDP scans as SYN scans is a good idea.

First, add a rule to reject packets from hosts on the UDP-PORTSCAN list
to the top of the OPEN-UDP chain.

    # iptables -I UDP -p udp -m recent --update --seconds 60 --name UDP-PORTSCAN -j REJECT --reject-with port-unreach

Next, modify the reject packets rule for UDP:

    # iptables -D INPUT -p udp -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreach
    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m recent --set --name UDP-PORTSCAN -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreach

Restore the Final Rule

If either or both of the portscanning tricks above were used the final
default rule is no longer the last rule in the INPUT chain. It needs to
be the last rule otherwise it will intercept the trick port scanner
rules you just added and they will never be used. Simply delete the rule
(-D), then add it once again using append (-A) which will place it at
the end of the chain.

    # iptables -D INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable
    # iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable

> Protection against other attacks

See the TCP/IP stack hardening guide for relevant kernel parameters.

SSH bruteforce attacks

Warning: Using an IP blacklist will stop trivial attacks but it relies
on an additional daemon and successful logging (the partition containing
/var can become full, especially if an attacker is pounding on the
server). Additionally, if the attacker knows your IP address, they can
send packets with a spoofed source header and get you locked out of the
server. SSH keys provide an elegant solution to the problem of brute
forcing without these problems.

To ban IP that makes too many password failures you can use Fail2ban or
Sshguard. These update firewall rules to reject the IP address.

  
 Here are some rules which help to mitigate ssh brute force attacks
using iptables:

    # iptables -N IN_SSH
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j IN_SSH
    # iptables -A IN_SSH -m recent --name sshbf --rttl --rcheck --hitcounts 3 --seconds 10 -j DROP
    # iptables -A IN_SSH -m recent --name sshbf --rttl --rcheck --hitcounts 4 --seconds 1800 -j DROP 
    # iptables -A IN_SSH -m recent --name sshbf --set -j ACCEPT

Ensure that:

    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j IN_SSH

is in an appropriate position in the iptables.rules file.

This arrangement works for the IN_SSH rule if you followed this entire
wiki so far:

    *
    -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j IN_SSH
    -A INPUT -p udp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j UDP
    *

> Saving the rules

The ruleset is now finished and should be saved to your hard drive so
that it can be loaded on every boot.

The systemd unit file points to the location where the rule
configuration will be saved:

    iptables=/etc/iptables/iptables.rules
    ip6tables=/etc/iptables/ip6tables.rules

Save the rules with this command:

    # iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules

and make sure your rules are loaded on boot:

    # systemctl enable iptables.service

Check that the rules load correctly using:

    # systemctl start iptables.service && systemctl status iptables.service

> IPv6

If you do not use IPv6 (most ISPs do not support it), you should disable
it.

Otherwise, you should enable the firewall rules for IPv6. Just copy
/etc/iptables/iptables.rules to /etc/iptables/ip6tables.rules and change
IPs from v4 format to v6 format and change reject messages from

    --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

to

    --reject-with icmp6-port-unreachable

etc.

Please be aware that --reject-with icmp6-proto-unreachable does not
exist for ICMPv6, so you may reject without any message. (Does anyone
know what message would be correct? communication-prohibited?
port-unreachable?).

Now you need to enable the ip6tables service using systemd:

     # systemctl enable ip6tables.service

Setting up a NAT gateway
------------------------

This section of the HOWTO deals with NAT gateways. It is assumed that
you already read the first part of the HOWTO and set up the INPUT,
OUTPUT, OPEN and interfaces chains like described above. All rules so
far have been created in the filter table. In this section, we will also
have to use the nat table.

> Setting up the filter table

Creating necessary chains

In our setup, we will use another two chains in the filter table, the
fw-interfaces and fw-open chains. Create them with the commands

    # iptables -N fw-interfaces
    # iptables -N fw-open

Setting up the FORWARD chain

Setting up the FORWARD chain is similar to the INPUT chain in the first
section.

Now we set up a rule with the conntrack match, identical to the one in
the INPUT chain:

    # iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

The next step is to enable forwarding for trusted interfaces and to make
all packets pass the fw-open chain.

    # iptables -A FORWARD -j fw-interfaces 
    # iptables -A FORWARD -j fw-open 

The remaining packets are denied with an ICMP message:

    # iptables -A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-unreach
    # iptables -P FORWARD DROP

Setting up the fw-interfaces and fw-open chains

The meaning of the fw-interfaces and fw-open chains is explained later,
when we deal with the POSTROUTING and PREROUTING chains in the nat
table, respectively.

> Setting up the nat table

All over this section, we assume that the outgoing interface (the one
with the public internet IP) is ppp0. Keep in mind that you have to
change the name in all following rules if your outgoing interface has
another name.

Setting up the POSTROUTING chain

Now, we have to define who is allowed to connect to the internet. Let's
assume we have the subnet 192.168.0.0/24 (which means all addresses that
are of the form 192.168.0.*) on eth0. We first need to accept the
machines on this interface in the FORWARD table, that is why we created
the fw-interfaces chain above:

    # iptables -A fw-interfaces -i eth0 -j ACCEPT

Now, we have to alter all outgoing packets so that they have our public
IP address as the source address, instead of the local LAN address. To
do this, we use the MASQUERADE target:

    # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE

Do not forget the -o ppp0 parameter above. If you omit it, your network
will be screwed up.

Let's assume we have another subnet, 10.3.0.0/16 (which means all
addresses 10.3.*.*), on the interface eth1. We add the same rules as
above again:

    # iptables -A fw-interfaces -i eth1 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.3.0.0/16 -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE

The last step is to enable IP Forwarding (if it is not already enabled):

    # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Then edit the relevant line in /etc/sysctl.conf so it persists through
reboot:

    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

Machines from these subnets can now use your new NAT machine as their
gateway. Note that you may want to set up a DNS and DHCP server like
dnsmasq or a combination of bind and dhcpd to simplify network settings
DNS resolution on the client machines. This is not the topic of this
HOWTO.

Setting up the PREROUTING chain

Sometimes, we want to change the address of an incoming packet from the
gateway to a LAN machine. To do this, we use the fw-open chain defined
above, as well as the PREROUTING chain in the nat table

I will give two simple examples: First, we want to change all incoming
SSH packets (port 22) to the ssh server in the machine 192.168.0.5:

    # iptables -A fw-open -d 192.168.0.5 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.5

The second example will show you how to change packets to a different
port than the incoming port. We want to change any incoming connection
on port 8000 to our web server on 192.168.0.6, port 80:

    # iptables -A fw-open -d 192.168.0.6 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.6:80

The same setup also works with udp packets.

> Saving the rules

Save the rules

    # iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules

and make sure your rules are loaded when you boot

    # systemctl enable iptables.service
