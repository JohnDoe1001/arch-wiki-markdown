MediaWiki supports full text search. The limitations of this feature is
that it indexes only words longer than 3 characters. If you want to
search for shorter words (1 to 3 characters) then a known workaround is
to use Google's sitesearch feature. Enter your search items in the form
and it will automatically search within ArchWiki.

Of course, you can do the same manually by appending
site:wiki.archlinux.org to Google searches:

    your search items site:wiki.archlinux.org

This works fine, but it is not live. Google is indexing the ArchWiki
every 1 to 3 days.
