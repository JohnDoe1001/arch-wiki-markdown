2012
----

There does not seem to have been an April Fools' Day joke for 2012.

Canterbury
----------

published: 2011 / permalink: Arch news archive #519

> History

At the FOSDEM 2011 Distribution collaboration event the lead developers
of Archlinux and Debian discussed the idea of combining the best
features of their projects and work together to produce a new, superior
distribution. This concept was first raised at an earlier openSUSE
conference and they believe there is potential to work together,
combining their efforts.

A week later, Feb 16, the Linux Standard Base version 4.1 was released.
With a new standard base to work on, a unified distribution became a hot
topic again; Gentoo and Grml got on board.

Dieter, the mastermind behind the dual ISO/usb-IMG installer file has
already started working on the new installer discussion is underway,
working out they will take care of further merging of the harder parts,
such as infrastructure and system tools.

> Goal

The target is to produce a really unified effort and be able to stand up
in a combined effort against proprietary operating systems, to show off
that the Free Software community is actually able to work together for a
common goal instead of creating more diversity.

> Features

The Canterbury distribution will combine the best of the linux world to
another game changer for the good of the users:

-   Simple as Arch - technologically simple and bleeding edge.
-   Stable as Debian - highly dependable.
-   Malleable as Gentoo - you get what you really want.
-   Live as Grml - readily usable.
-   Openminded as openSUSE - broad and welcoming for everyone.

April Fools Challenge
---------------------

published: 2010 / permalink: Arch news archive #492

It is that time of year again, but this year we are being super subtle.
In fact so subtle, many of you will not notice the April Fools at all.
But there is definitely one there. Post your guesses in this dedicated
forum thread. We have a donated netbook to give away as a prize for the
first person who fully uncovers the joke.

Dropping i686 Support
---------------------

published: 2009 / permalink: Arch news archive #440

Recently the developers have been discussing the possibility of adding
some additional optimizations to our i686 port to improve multimedia
support. This would involve reducing the compatibility with older
systems. As some of you may have heard ([1], Google translation [2]),
this discussion has resulted in the decision to focus exclusively on the
x86_64 port. The overall opinion of the developers is that the x86_64
port is now complete enough to justify this decision and that this is in
keeping with Arch's philosophy of supporting current generation
hardware. The x86_64 architecture has been available since 2002
(compared to i686 which is from 1995), and we believe most of our i686
users have x86_64 compatible hardware.

An official time-line for the deprecation of the i686 port has not been
established, but an official announcement needs to be made, as the
decision has already been leaked to the ArchLinux-BR community. However,
it is likely that major updates (GNOME, KDE, Xorg, etc) will not be
built for i686 in the immediate future. Users will still be able to
build packages for i686 packages using ABS. As most of the architecture
specific patches are for x86_64, this should be relatively pain free.

> About the dropping i686 support joke

On April 1st, 2009, it was announced on the frontpage, as well as the
Arch-Dev-Public mailing list that Arch would be dropping support for the
i686 architecture. This announcement spurred a number of heated debates
across the forums, mailing lists, and on IRC. Among other things, the
debates led Aaron to threaten to leave Arch. Similar to previous years,
various phrases on the forums and other Arch sites were filtered to make
life more entertaining.

> After-action Report

published: 2009 / permalink: Arch news archive #441

Hi, Arch Linux users, we are pleased to inform you that the i686
architecture is not going to be dropped from Arch Linux. It all was part
of an April Fools joke, in which all the developers and the forum
moderators played a big part.

Interestingly, this joke actually did some good. Some of our users
discovered that they were, in fact, running 64-bit processors, and many
of them switched to the Arch Linux 64-bit version. We encourage anyone
who already switched to keep using the 64-bit version, to continue
contributing to the architecture and encourage support from other major
software vendors.

A prime example of a vendor giving in to the demands of the 64-bit
community is Adobe. They've recently added 64-bit Linux support to the
flash plug-in, for which we thank them.

Sorry for any inconvenience this joke may have caused, but how can we
resist a prank on the 1st of April?

Arch in German
--------------

published: 2008 / permalink: n/a

Important Notice for English Archers

Over the past two months, great discussion has passed on the private
development list, and we have come to the conclusion that keeping Arch
as a primarily English distro is a disservice to our largest user-base.
As such, we have decided in majority vote to change the official,
primary language of Arch Linux to German.

Please bear with us during this transition - we are working closely with
archlinux.de to facilitate the switch, at which point we plan to merge
the websites. Knowing the great community behind Arch, we are sure a
community project will arise quickly to fill the small void left when we
completely discontinue the English site.

Also, please note we're now using the German pronunciation for "Arch".
Don't worry, you'll get used to it - 90% of our devs already are!

Happy Computenpeepers, The Management

> About the German Arch joke

On April 1st, 2008, most of Arch Linux websites (including the BBS) were
translated to German. The above notice appeared on most of them, and the
BBS rewrote strings posted by users so that references to the Wiki
articles all pointed to a page called "Deutchland", and words like
"joke" were rewritten as "genius idea". For example: "Arch Linux April
Jokes Collection" would read "Arch Linux Deutschland genius idea
Collection".

Arch Ark
--------

published: 2007 / permalink: Arch news archive #307

We're changing our name!

After 5 years of being called Arch Linux and 5 years of people confusing
us with Ark Linux, we've finally come up with a solution. We've spent
the last few months talking to the Ark Linux people to come up with a
solution that's beneficial for both distributions. Today, we are happy
to announce a name change for Arch Linux. Today, I am happy to announce,
we will be known as Ark Linux!

We will keep our domain archlinux.org for the next few weeks, while
people are still getting used to the name change, but eventually we will
switch domains as well. In changing names, we are sure that people will
never again have problems discerning Arch Linux with Ark Linux.

Long Live Ark Linux!

> Ark Linux

Ark Linux was an actual Linux distribution (since discontinued [1]). The
above joke is especially funny to those Archers who started using Arch
after mistakingly typing "www.archlinux.org" instead of
"www.arklinux.org". The "Arch Linux" name is considered to be pronounced
as /a-ch/ (rhymes with larch, starch, as in "archer"). However, there
does not seem to exist a consensus on how it is really pronounced.[2]

The same joke was also posted on Ark Linux to make it even more
convincing (at the first glance, at least; sadly, there does not seem to
be an archive of Ark Linux news).

Judd goes to Google
-------------------

published: 2006 / permalink: Arch news archive #214

Current Changes

I just thought I would bring you all up to speed on some of the
information currently going around the watercooler.

Judd has officially accepted a job offer from Google, and as such, will
be unable to continue with his Archlinux work.

Lead of the project has moved to the capable hands of Jason Chu
(Xentac). Jason's first order of business, as we push towards the
0.7.1.1 release (Codename: Pony), will be creating a [stable]
repository, with older software. This will be the main focus of our work
from now on, with all the security backports and compatability fixes. As
such, the normal repos will begin to lack a bit, but those will be
removed in time as we move to a more 'stable' and 'production quality'
release system.

Expect 0.7.1.1 in a few weeks.

Thanks, Aaron

> Judd's actual goodbye to Arch project

Judd Vinet, the founder of Arch Linux, has actually left the project on
the 1st of October, 2007, and became the "Arch's Number One
Cheerleader".[3] Since then, Aaron Griffin is the project leader.

> Arch Linux and its release system

Arch Linux does not use the stable and production quality release
system. It is a rolling release system, where the system is constantly
kept up-to-date with no fixed release schedules.

Arch against Wombats
--------------------

published: 2005 / permalink: Arch news archive #147

CETW Problems

It is with great sadness that I write this message.

When we first released Arch Linux 0.7 (Wombat) we were contacted by the
Centre for Ethical Treatment of Wombats (CETW). CETW felt that we were
somehow hurting wombats worldwide by releasing an "open source project"
with the codename Wombat. While we tried to convince them that Arch
Linux was a Linux distribution and that no wombats were harmed during
the creation of our release, they wouldn't accept it.

So they threatened to sue us unless we changed our destructive ways.

After much deliberation, we have figured out that we do not actually
have enough money to fight them in court. Instead we have chosen to
settle outside of court. Part of our settlement is to discontinue the
development of Arch Linux.

And thus, through a poor choice of naming, Arch Linux is no more. All of
the developers would like to thank the community for their support and
contributions.

> Wombats

"Wombats are Australian marsupials; they are short-legged, muscular
quadrupeds, approximately one metre (39 inches) in length with a very
short tail. They are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas
of south-eastern Australia and Tasmania. The name wombat comes from the
Eora Aboriginal community who were the original inhabitants of the
Sydney area." wikipedia:Wombat

Wombats are not known to hire lawyers to harass Linux

GNOME 2.6
---------

published: 2004 / permalink: Arch news archive #58

GNOME 2.6 Released!

As the title says, gnome 2.6 is in the house. There isn't much to watch
out for, Arjan and JGC did a good job catching conflicts in the testing
stage so the install should go flawlessly.

To upgrade: pacman -Syu To install: pacman -S gnome

Some GTK2.x related packages were also upgraded to suit the requirements
of gnome 2.6.

> GNOME version history

Before the above news was posted, the GNOME project had released 2.0 in
2002, and latest release before the 1st of April 2004 was GNOME 2.2.[4]
