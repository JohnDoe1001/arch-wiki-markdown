Installation
------------

The EEE Top does not have an optical drive installed on the machine.
This means you will need to install Arch Linux through one of the
alternative methods:

1.  External USB CD-ROM drive
2.  USB pen drive (Recommended)
3.  Network (PXE)

See the Beginners' guide for more information.
