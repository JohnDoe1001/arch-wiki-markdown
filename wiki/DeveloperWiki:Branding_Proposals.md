Introduction
============

This article is part of the DeveloperWiki. Feel free to add any
suggestions or concerns.

  

Separate branding from upstream packages
========================================

Create a separate package of artwork for upstream packages, including:

-   login themes
-   desktop environment additions (wallpapers, icons, etc.)
-   splash screens

Include post-install notes informing the user where to find the theme
and where to modify its preference.

Pros

-   Upstream packages are delivered as-is
-   Users can choose whether to download Arch-branded content

Cons

-   Users will have to modify theme settings manually

  

Package Naming Scheme
=====================

If artwork is separated from upstream packages, we should have a
consistent naming scheme, for example:

-   archlinux-artwork
-   archlinux-wallpaper
-   archlinux-themes-gdm
-   archlinux-themes-kdm
-   archlinux-themes-slim
-   archlinux-themes-xfce

  

Essential Artwork
=================

Provide at least 1 style-neutral (minimalist) theme for the standard
packages:

Completed

-   Framebuffer logo
-   SLiM
-   Qingy
-   Splashy
-   GDM
-   KDM

Pending

-   XDM
