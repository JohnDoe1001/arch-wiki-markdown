Taken from the Stjerm page: Stjerm is a GTK+-based drop-down terminal
emulator similar to the consoles used in PC games such as Quake and
Half-Life 2. Stjerm sets itself apart from similar programs by providing
a minimalistic interface combined with a small file size, lightweight
memory usage and easy integration with composite window managers such as
Compiz.

Installation
------------

Stjerm is available in the AUR: stjerm

Configuration
-------------

Stjerm can be configured via the terminal or through the .Xdefaults file
located in your home directory. For example, to run stjerm with F12 as
shortcut key, the opacity of 60 and a green foreground color, use:

     stjerm -k f12 -o 60 -fg 66ff11

To specify the same options in the .Xdefaults file:

     stjerm.key: f12
     stjerm.opacity: 60
     stjerm.foreground: #66ff11

For a complete list of options, see the ConfigurationOptions wiki page.
