From Wikipedia:

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a
traditional user interface for the Unix operating system and for
Unix-like systems. Users direct the operation of the computer by
entering commands as text for a command line interpreter to execute or
by creating text scripts of one or more such commands.

List of shells
--------------

-   Bash — Shell, or command language interpreter, that will appear in
    the GNU operating system. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that
    incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell
    (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO
    9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements
    over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most
    sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

-   C shell — Command language interpreter usable both as an interactive
    login shell and a shell script command processor. It includes a
    command-line editor, programmable word completion, spelling
    correction, a history mechanism, job control and a C-like syntax.

-   DASH — POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as
    small as possible. It does this without sacrificing speed where
    possible. In fact, it is significantly faster than Bash (the GNU
    Bourne-Again SHell) for most tasks.

-   fish — Smart and user-friendly command line shell for OS X, Linux,
    and the rest of the family. Fish performs full-color command line
    syntax highlighting, as well as highlighting and completion for
    commands and their arguments, file existence, and history. It
    supports complete-as-you-type for history and commands. Fish is able
    to parse the system's man pages in order to determine valid
    arguments for commands, allowing it to highlight and complete
    commands. Easy last-command revision can be done using Alt-Up. The
    fish daemon (fishd) facilitates synchronized history across all
    instances of fish, as well as universal and persistent environment
    variables.

-   Korn shell — The KornShell language was designed and developed by
    David G. Korn at AT&T Bell Laboratories. It is an interactive
    command language that provides access to the UNIX system and to many
    other systems, on the many different computers and workstations on
    which it is implemented. The KornShell language is also a complete,
    powerful, high-level programming language for writing applications,
    often more easily and quickly than with other high-level languages.
    This makes it especially suitable for prototyping. There are two
    other widely used shells, the Bourne shell developed by Steven
    Bourne at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and the C shell developed by Bill
    Joy at the University of California. ksh has the best features of
    both, plus many new features of its own. Thus ksh can do much to
    enhance your productivity and the quality of your work, both in
    interacting with the system, and in programming. ksh programs are
    easier to write, and are more concise and readable than programs
    written in a lower level language such as C.

-   Oh — Unix shell written in Go. It is similar in spirit but different
    in detail from other Unix shells. Oh extends the shell's programming
    language features without sacrificing the shell's interactive
    features.

-   rc — Command interpreter for Plan 9 that provides similar facilities
    to UNIX’s Bourne shell, with some small additions and less
    idiosyncratic syntax.

-   Zsh — Shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a
    powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of Bash,
    ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into Zsh; many original features
    were added. The introductory document details some of the unique
    features of Zsh.
