Community Art Sites
-------------------

-   DeviantArt Wallpapers : A HUGE collection, but *finding* wallpapers
    that match personal taste can be a little like searching for a
    needle in a haystack. For every wallpaper I find on deviantart that
    I like, I probably view 50 to 100 that I do not like.

Wallpaper Sites
---------------

-   Interface Lift : Nice collection of high resolution images. A lot of
    great landscape/nature photos.
-   Backgrounds Archive : A lot of photos, many of them have a
    stock-photo appearance. I find this site kind of boring actually.

-   Mandolux : A tonne of wallpapers with the "stock photo" feel. All
    wallpapers have multiple resolutions including dual monitor and
    widescreen.

Specialty Sites
---------------

-   Digital Blasphemy : For many years Digital Blasphemy has been
    producing very high quality 3D art in wallpaper format. Some of the
    content is only available for paying users, but the free stuff is
    always worth looking at.

-   Sexy Desktop : A huge collection of high-quality wallpapers of
    (mostly) female models, actresses, singers, etc. Some of the photos
    are definitely NSFW, but for the most part there is not a lot of
    nudity or other porn-like photos. Most of the "raciest" content
    merely consists of models posing in swimsuits and/or women showing
    cleavage.
