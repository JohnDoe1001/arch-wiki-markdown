Cgroups
=======

cgroups (aka control groups) is a Linux kernel feature to limit, police
and account the resource usage of certain processes (actually process
groups). Compared to other approaches like the 'nice' command or
/etc/security/limits.conf, cgroups are infinitely more flexible.

Control groups can be used in multiple ways:

-   create and manage them on the fly using tools like cgcreate, cgexec,
    cgclassify etc
-   the "rules engine daemon", to automatically move certain
    users/groups/commands to groups (/etc/cgrules.conf and
    /usr/lib/systemd/system/cgconfig.service)
-   through other software such as Linux Containers (LXC) virtualization

Unfortunately this feature is often underappreciated due to lack of easy
"how-to" style documentation. This is an attempt of fixing the
problem.Â :)

Note: I'm only learning to use cgroups as I type this, so do not take
everything I say here as pure gold.

Installing
----------

First, install the utilities for managing cgroups; you need to install
the libcgroup package from the AUR.

Simple usage
------------

> Ad-hoc groups

One of the powers of cgroups is that you can create "ad-hoc" groups on
the fly. In fact, you can even grant the privileges to create custom
groups to regular users. Run this as root (replace $USER with your user
name and groupname with the name you want to give to the cgroup):

    sudo cgcreate -a $USER -g memory,cpu:groupname

That's it! Now all the tunables in the group groupname are writable by
your user:

    $ ls -l /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/groupname
    total 0
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cgroup.event_control
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cgroup.procs
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cpu.rt_period_us
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cpu.rt_runtime_us
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cpu.shares
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 notify_on_release
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 tasks

Cgroups are hierarchical, so you can create as many subgroups as you
like. Let's say that, as a normal user, you want to run a bash shell
under a new subgroup called 'foo':

    cgcreate -g memory,cpu:groupname/foo
    cgexec   -g memory,cpu:groupname/foo bash

There we go! Just to make sure:

    $ cat /proc/self/cgroup
    11:memory:/groupname/foo
    6:cpu:/groupname/foo

A new subdirectory was created for this group. To limit the memory usage
of all processes in this group to 10 MB, run the following:

    $ echo 10000000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/groupname/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes

Note that the memory limit applies to RAM use only -- once tasks hit
this limit, they will begin to swap. But it won't affect the performance
of other processes significantly.

Similarly you can change the CPU priority ("shares") of this group. By
default all groups have 1024 shares. A group with 100 shares will get a
~10% portion of the CPU time:

    $ echo 100 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/groupname/foo/cpu.shares

You can find more tunables or statistics by listing the cgroup
directory.

You can also change the cgroup of already running processes. To move all
'bash' commands to this group:

    $ pidof bash
    13244 13266
    $ cgclassify -g memory,cpu:groupname/foo `pidof bash`
    $ cat /proc/13244/cgroup
    11:memory:/groupname/foo
    6:cpu:/groupname/foo

> Persistent group configuration

If you want your cgroups to be created at boot, you can define them in
/etc/cgconfig.conf instead. For example, the "groupname" and
"groupname/foo" group definitions would look like this:

    /etc/cgconfig.conf 

    group groupname {
      perm {
    # who can manage limits
        admin {
          uid = $USER;
        }
    # who can add tasks to this group
        task {
          uid = $USER;
        }
      }
    # create this group in cpu and memory controllers
      cpu { }
      memory { }
    }

    group groupname/foo {
      cpu {
        cpu.shares = 100;
      }
      memory {
        memory.limit_in_bytes = 10000000;
      }
    }

Note:Comments should begin at the start of a line! The # character for
comments must appear as the first character of a line. Else,
cgconfigparser will have problem parsing it but will only report cgroup
change of group failed as the error.

> Useful examples

Matlab
------

Matlab does not have any protection against taking all your machine's
memory or CPU. Launching a large calculation can thus trash your system.
Here's the what I have put in /etc/cgconfig.conf to protect from this
(replace $USER with your username):

    /etc/cgconfig.conf 

    # Prevent Matlab from taking all memory
    group matlab {
        perm {
            admin {
                uid = $USER;
            }
            task {
                uid = $USER;
            }
        }

        cpuset {
            cpuset.mems="0";
            cpuset.cpus="0-5";
        }
        memory {;
    # 5 GiB limit
            memory.limit_in_bytes = 5368709120;
        }
    }

This cgroup will bind Matlab to cores 0 to 5 (I have 8, so Matlab will
only see 6) and cap its memory usage to 5 GiB. The "cpu" resource
constrain can also be defined to prevent CPU usage, but I find the
"cpuset" constrain to be sufficient.

Launch matlab like this:

    $ cgexec -g memory,cpuset:matlab /opt/MATLAB/2012b/bin/matlab -desktop

Make sure to use the right path to the executable.

For information on controllers and what certain switches and tunables
mean, refer to kernel's Documentation/cgroup (or install linux-docs and
see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/cgroup

For commands and configuration files, see relevant man pages, e.g.
man cgcreate or man cgrules.conf
