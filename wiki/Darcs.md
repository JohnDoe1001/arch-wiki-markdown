Darcs is a free and open source, cross-platform version control system,
like git, mercurial or subversion but with a very different approach.
Thanks to its focus on changes rather than snapshots, Darcs can offer a
freer way of working, and a simpler user interface.

Installation
------------

There is no official package for that, but you could installing via AUR
package darcs-bin.
