Package Proxy Cache
===================

If you want to install the same Arch packages over and over - like for
testing AIF profiles - it could help if you wouldn't have to get the
packages every time from the internet. This article shows you how to
setup a Squid proxy that only caches arch packages and can be used with
aif/pacman/wget/etc with minimal configuration on the client system.

Install Squid
-------------

    # pacman -S squid

Configure Squid
---------------

This is the minimum configuration to get squid cache arch packages.

> Cache Rules

Before defining these rules, remove/comment (if you do not need them)
all the default refresh_patterns

    /etc/squid/squid.conf 

    refresh_pattern \.pkg\.tar\.   0       20%     4320      reload-into-ims
    refresh_pattern .              0       0%      0

That should define that *.pkg.tar.* gets cached, and anything else
should not.

Tip:http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/refresh_pattern

> Maximum Filesize

Objects larger than this size will NOT be saved on disk:

    /etc/squid/squid.conf 

    maximum_object_size 256 MB

Tip:http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/maximum_object_size

> Cache Directory

Set the cache dir and its maximum size and subdirs:

    /etc/squid/squid.conf 

    cache_dir aufs /var/cache/squid 10000 16 256

Tip:http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_dir

> Shutdown Lifetime

Time to wait until all active client sockets are closed:

    /etc/squid/squid.conf 

    shutdown_lifetime 1 seconds 

Tip:http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/shutdown_lifetime

> Note:

Every time you change the cache_dir path (and after fresh install), you
need to (re)create this directory:

    # squid -z

and it could be helpful to check the config file before running squid:

    # squid -k check

Start Squid
-----------

    # /etc/rc.d/squid start

or if squid is already running:

    # /etc/rc.d/squid restart

> Note:

It could be helpful to check the config file before running:

    # squid -k check

Follow Squid access log
-----------------------

To see the access to squid:

    # tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log

You should see this for packages that are directed to original host:

    ...TCP_MISS/200...DIRECT...

and for packages that are delivered from the cache:

    ...TCP_HIT/200...NONE...

Manual Arch Install
-------------------

Before running /arch/setup, add variables for your proxy. To do so, run
on the console:

    # export http_proxy='http://your_squid_machine_ip:3128'# export ftp_proxy='ftp://your_squid_machine_ip:3128'

Now just use /arch/setup to normally install the system, and it should
use your proxy. Watch the squid logs to verify this.

Note:If you want to use the proxy settings in the installed system, you
need to add the http_proxy and/or ftp_proxy variables in an appropriate
place on the installed system. (like /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh)

Automatic Arch Install
----------------------

After login in the arch install image, setup your network (eg. `dhcpcd
eth0`) and get this AIF profile on it.

Warning:This PARTITIONS AND FORMATS the defined device, so please go
through the whole file before you run it!

    custom.aifprofile

    export ftp_proxy='ftp://your_squid_machine_ip:3128'
    export http_proxy='http://your_squid_machine_ip:3128'

    SOURCE=net
    FILE_URL='http://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/$repo/os/i686'
    SYNC_URL='http://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/$repo/os/i686'
    HARDWARECLOCK=localtime
    TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
    RUNTIME_REPOSITORIES=
    RUNTIME_PACKAGES=

    TARGET_GROUPS=base
    TARGET_PACKAGES_EXCLUDE=
    #TARGET_PACKAGES='xorg gnome ttf-dejavu'

    worker_configure_system () {
    	prefill_configs
    	echo "export http_proxy=$http_proxy" >> /mnt/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
    	echo "export ftp_proxy=$ftp_proxy" >> /mnt/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
    	chmod +x /mnt/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
    	sed -i 's/^HOSTNAME="myhost"/HOSTNAME="foohost"/' $var_TARGET_DIR/etc/rc.conf
    }

    GRUB_DEVICE=/dev/sda
    PARTITIONS='/dev/sda *:ext4'
    BLOCKDATA='/dev/sda1 raw no_label ext4;yes;/;target;no_opts;no_label;no_params'

And install the system according to that profile:

    # aif -p automatic -c custom.aifprofile

Now sit back, and enjoy the automationÂ :)

Tip: Watch the squid logs, specially that on the second run you get
TCP_HIT and NONE

After the setup is done, the installed system should use your proxy for
pacman/wget/etc.
