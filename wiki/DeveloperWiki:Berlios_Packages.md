DeveloperWiki:Berlios Packages
==============================

berlios will be closed with the end of this year. See
http://www.berlios.de/ Projects hosted there will have to move
elsewhere.

Edit: There will be a new association/club that wants to support the
platform. If nevertheless projects will move to another place, this can
be documented here.
