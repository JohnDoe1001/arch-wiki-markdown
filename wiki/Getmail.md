getmail is a mail retriever designed to allow you to get your mail from
one or more mail accounts on various mail servers to your local machine
for reading with a minimum of fuss. getmail is designed to be secure,
flexible, reliable, and easy-to-use. getmail is designed to replace
other mail retrievers such as fetchmail. For more detailed information,
please see the official getmail documentation.

Installation
------------

Install the package getmail from the official repositories.

Configuration
-------------

-   Create a configuration dir and set the right permissions by
    executing: $ mkdir -m 0700 ~/.getmail.
-   Create a configuration file, the default being:
    ~/.getmail/getmailrc. A separate configuration file is needed for
    each mailserver to pick up mail from. Configuration files other than
    the default, will have to be explicitly passed as arguments to the
    getmail command.
