Termite
=======

Termite is a minimal and lightweight terminal emulator designed for use
with tiling window managers. It is a modal application, similar to Vim,
having an insert mode and a command mode, during which keybindings have
different functions. Its configuration file allows for customizations
such as color and keybindings. Termite supports transparency and 256
colors. It is designed with a look and feel similar to urxvt, but with
fewer dependencies and lower resource usage.

Installation
------------

Termite is based on the vte terminal emulator library, and is available
from the Arch User Repository in the package termite-git.

Getting Started
---------------

Termite starts in insert mode by default. Text may be selected using the
mouse, or by using command-mode keys. In insert mode, Ctrl-Shift-c may
be used to copy selected text to the X clipboard; Ctrl-Shift-v to paste.
Ctrl-tab starts scrollback completion, and Ctrl-Shift-up/Ctrl-Shift-down
scroll the screen up or down. Ctrl-Shift-space enters command-mode,
which changes keybindings and behavior. Many commands are borrowed from
Vim, for example v for visual mode, Shift-v for visual line mode, Ctrl-v
for visual block mode, y to copy ("yank") selected text, / and ? for
searching, w, b, ^, $ for movement, and Escape to go back to insert
mode.
