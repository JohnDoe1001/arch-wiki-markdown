Installing
----------

To install amsn with pacman:

    # pacman -S amsn

There are also packages in the AUR for extra plugins and skins. See here
for plugins and here for skins

Troubleshooting
---------------

> No sound in aMSN

The snack library is not available in Arch default repository, it is
however available in the AUR [1].

> Audio or audio+video conferencing isn't working

Audio calls and audio+video calls aren't working anymore due to a change
of protocol from Microsoft, as can be seen here [2].

This only concerns “Audio call” or “Audio+Video Call” which goes in both
directions as confirmed here [3]
