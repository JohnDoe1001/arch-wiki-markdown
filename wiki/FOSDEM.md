> Meetup info

Meeting points

-   downtown meeting point: entrance of "galerie ravenstein", at the
    central station.
-   FOSDEM meeting point: at the door of the Cross Distribution Devroom
    H.1301

Meetups

-   Friday afternoon: some guys will do some sightseeing (or suggest
    something else). Everybody will probably arrive at different times
    so maybe meeting up at this stage is not convenient/suitable.
    However if you're interested, post here at which point you could
    make it to the downtown meeting point and maybe a meetup can be
    arranged
    -   Jan Steffens (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 13:35)
    -   Pierre Schmitz (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 13:35)
    -   Roman Kyrylych (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 11:51)
    -   Tom Gundersen (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 14:17)

-   Friday evening: meetup downtown @ 7PM at the downtown meeting point.
    We'll go out for dinner (made reservation @bigmama 7:15) and
    afterwards drinks. We'll visit the FOSDEM beer event but it's
    usually insanely overcrowded so we'll probably go somewhere else.
    -   Jan Steffens
    -   Pierre Schmitz
    -   Roman Kyrylych
    -   prometheus (no asian food if possible, no offence ;))
    -   Dieter (no sushi)
    -   Anntoin Wilkinson (vegetarian) - bigmama or pizzahut would be
        fine though.
    -   Tom Gundersen
    -   the_metalgamer
    -   Romain Schmitz (added on Jan 30th, if I'm too late, my bad ;-) )

-   Saturday evening: meetup at the FOSDEM meeting point @ 7:15PM (last
    talks end at 7PM)
    -   no sure yet what to do. another drinks/dinner?
        -   Jan Steffens
        -   Pierre Schmitz
        -   Roman Kyrylych
        -   Dieter (no sushi)
        -   Anntoin Wilkinson

        -   Tom Gundersen

        (with food & drinks)
        -   Romain Schmitz

> restaurants under consideration
