What is it?
-----------

The Desktop Project aims to fill the hole left by many applications
developers: the .desktop files. These files are the ones that allow you,
in a FreeDesktop-compliant WM/DE, to see the installed applications in
the system menu, along with their icon, allowing you to access them in
an easy way. Unfortunately, many applications do not include a .desktop
file, so you have to write one yourself or launch them from a command
line.

What can you do?
----------------

Just add the graphical applications you use that are not listed in your
system menu to the list below. I (bardo) will write/modify the necessary
files and notify the corresponding maintainers so they can be added to
the packages. Of course any help/comment/critic is really appreciatedÂ :)
