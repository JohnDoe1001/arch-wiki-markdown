There is quite a good tutorial to make the MFC-7360N work on Arch. Look
here. It works perfectly. Some minor additions:

Links to the relevant files are (taken from here):

-   The LPR driver
-   The cupswrapper driver

And the Brother scanner software is in the AUR (you do not have to
download/install it manually):

    yaourt -S brscan4

Have fun!
