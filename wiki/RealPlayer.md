This article describes how to play .rmvb video files.

Installation
------------

The most simple way is to install VLC, which plays .rmvb now, as well as
many other video format.

    # pacman -S vlc

Or you can install realplayer from the AUR.

Next, start it with:

    $ realplay &

On the first run, a configuration wizard will set up the necessary
options.

  

.ram files
----------

To play .ram files, this script is intended to replace the use of
realplayer by using vlc insteadÂ :

See comments inside.

Conversion of RealMedia Files
-----------------------------

As RealMedia files are not widely (nor well) supported, it may be useful
to convert them to another format. FFmpeg can be used for this.

    # pacman -S ffmpeg

For example, to convert the video foo.rm to an mp4 file:

    ffmpeg -i foo.rm -vcodec mpeg4 -sameq -acodec libfaac -ab 94208 foo.mp4
