File Recovery

Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers,
footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred
to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those
generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The
headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can
use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in
types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a
more reliable and faster recovery.

Installation
------------

foremost is available on the AUR.

Configuration
-------------

In most cases, it's not necessary to configure Foremost, since in
default operation, it already recognizes most of the usual file types.
Nevertheless, one could add additional file headers for detection, e.g.
adding entries or uncomment examples:

    /etc/foremost.conf

    #	wma     y       8000000  \x30\x26\xB2\x75    \x00\x00\x00\xFF
    #
    #	wma     y       8000000  \x30\x26\xB2\x75    \x52\x9A\x12\x46
    #
    	mp3     y    	8000000 \xFF\xFB??\x44\x00\x00
    	mp3     y    	8000000 \x57\x41\x56\45            \x00\x00\xFF\
    	mp3     y    	8000000 \xFF\xFB\xD0\            \xD1\x35\x51\xCC\
    	mp3     y    	8000000 \x49\x44\x33\
    	mp3     y    	8000000 \x4C\x41\x4D\x45\

Usage
-----

Note:Instead on working directly on the hard disc which should be
recovered, consider creating a backup image, for example using dd_rescue
and use this with Foremost.

Run following command with image or device path as parameter and
additional path to an output directory:

    sudo foremost -t all -i /path/to/image -o outputdir

The parameter -t all tries to recover all known file types.
