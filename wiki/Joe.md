Joe
===

Joe's Own Editor or Joe is a text editor for Unix. It serves as a stand
alone editor and has clones of Vim, Emacs, Pico and WordStar. It has
syntax highlighting for many common languages like Perl and C, and some
for more uncommon languages like Haskell and Ada.

Installing and Configuring
--------------------------

Joe can be installed with the joe package from the AUR or can be built
from source. Extra syntax highlighting files can be found here. Some are
updated files and some are brand new ones like the Erlang syntax
highlighting file.

Configuring is very straight forward, it's done through rc files,
located in either /etc/joe/ or /usr/local/etc/joe depending on how you
installed it. They can be edited there or copied to a home folder, for
example /home/user/.joerc.
