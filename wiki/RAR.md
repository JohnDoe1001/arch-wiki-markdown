WinRAR available in both the i686 and x86-64 flavors.

Key features
------------

-   Variable amounts of redundancy ("recovery record" or "recovery
    volumes" both of which are demonstrated below) can be added to an
    archive, making it more resistant to corruption. Even if parts of an
    archive are damaged, it is possible to fully recover the stored data
    if a large enough recovery record exists. On its own, Tar does not
    have this ability.
-   RAR is able to efficiently handle split volumes. Built-in support
    for multi-volume files enables the unpacking program to simply
    prompt the user for the next .partXXX RAR file, without the need to
    manually copy and then rejoin the pieces, or for extracting a file
    from a single piece without needing all pieces. RAR does not support
    tapes, as it uses seek and rename operations on its files.
-   RAR archives can be of a solid format, in which all of the
    compressed files are treated as a single data block. Most currently
    used compression formats (with the exception of the older ZIP) allow
    solid structuring.
-   Strong encryption capabilities. Older versions of the file format
    used a proprietary algorithm; newer versions use the AES encryption
    algorithm, a block cipher adopted as an encryption standard by the
    U.S. government. The only known ways to recover an encrypted file
    are via dictionary or brute force attacks. In newer versions,
    password protection can optionally protect filenames too, so that
    the filenames contained within the archive will not be displayed
    without the right password.

Installation
------------

> RAR

Obtain rar (full package minus UNRAR) available in the AUR which is
maintained by adaptee.

> UNRAR

The unrar is provided separately and resides in the official extra
repository. Install it via Pacman as usual:

     # pacman -S unrar

Configuration file
------------------

RAR for Linux reads configuration information from the file ~/.rarrc
(i.e. in the user's home directory) or if you wish to define a global
set of options for all users in the /etc directory.

The syntax of the file is simply the following string:

    switches=any RAR switches, separated by spaces

For example:

    switches=-m5 -rr5 -ol -msjpg;mp3;avi;zip;rar;tar;gz;jpg

For a complete listing and explanation of rar's switches, see the user's
manual

RAR compression examples
------------------------

> General syntax

    $ rar <command> -<switch 1> -<switch N> <archive> <files.rar> <@listfiles...>

For a complete listing of commands and switches, see the last section of
this article or simply run:

    $ rar | more

> Recursively compress an entire directory structure

-   Task: backup /home/darkhorse to /media/data/darkhorse-backup.rar
    using 10Â % recovery records.

    $ rar a -r -rr10 /media/data/darkhorse-backup.rar /home/darkhorse

-   Explained:

  -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Switch   Action
  a        adds files to archives.
  -r       recurse subdirectories (includes all dirs/files under the parent directory).
  -rr10    adds recovery records to the archive. This way up to 10% of the compressed archive can become corrupt or unusable, and it will be able to recover the data through parity.
  -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Mixed-mode archives

You can also use mixed-mode archives which means that file types you
specifiy do not get compressed - they simply get stored.

-   Task: backup /home/darkhorse to /media/data/darkhorse-backup.rar

    $ rar a -r -rr10 -s -m5 -msjpg;mp3;tar /media/data/darkhorse-backup.rar /home/darkhorse

-   Explained:

  ---------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Switch           Action
  a                adds files to archives.
  -r               recurse subdirectories (includes all dirs/files under the parent directory).
  -rr10            adds recovery records to the archive. This way up to 10% of the compressed archive can become corrupt or unusable, and it will be able to recover the data through parity.
  -m5              Use the highest level of compression (m0 = store ... m3 = default ... m5 = maximal level of compression.
  -msjpg;mp3;tar   ignore the compression option and store all .jpg and .mp3 and .tar files.
  ---------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Recursively compress many directory structures using a list

-   Task: backup /home/darkhorse and /home/palomino and /home/seabiscuit
    to /media/data/homes-backup.rar

First create a list (simple text file) containing the various targets.
In this example, the list will be three lines long. I named it
'home-list' in this example but you can call it anything you want:

    /home/darkhorse
    /home/palomino
    /home/seabiscuit

    $ rar a -r -rr10 -s /media/data/homes-backup.rar @/path/to/home-list

UNRAR examples
--------------

> General syntax

    $ unrar <command> -<switch 1> -<switch N> <archive> <files...> <@listfiles...> <path_to_extract\>

For a complete listing of commands and switches simply run:

    $ unrar --help

To extract into a new folder:

    $ unrar x /media/data/homes-backup.rar homes-backup/

For multi-part rar files, run:

    $ unrar x homes-backup.part1.rar homes-backup/
