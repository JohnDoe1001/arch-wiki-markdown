-   Sacred Gold — Hack'n Slay Roleplay Game like Diablo.

Tip: If running on a low resolution (netbook etc) either play it on
external monitor, but you can't see the skill/action bar. You can move
the Window pressing Alt+left_mouse. You can see the action bar, but then
you can't see the health bar anymore. Email Michael from
linuxgamepublishing.com and ask for a fix - would be really great if we
could fully enjoy this game on Linux netbooks
