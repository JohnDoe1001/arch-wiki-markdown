i3
==

i3 is a dynamic tiling window manager inspired by wmii that is primarily
targeted at developers and advanced users.

Clients (windows) are organized in a tree data structure within
containers. The tree branches via horizontal or vertical splits, and
containers can also be set to tabbed or stacked layouts. Floating
windows are available for corner cases that don't mix well with tiling,
and remain on a separate layer above the tiled windows.

Installation
------------

Install the i3 package group from the official repositories, which
includes the i3lock, i3status and i3-wm packages. Install i3-wm for the
window manger, i3status to write a status line to i3bar through stdout,
or i3lock for an improved screenlocker.

Additional packages are available in the Arch User Repository. Install
i3-git for the development version. Install i3-gnome to add a
GNOME-session.

Configuration
-------------

Edit your ~/.xinitrc and add:

    exec i3

If you want i3 to log its output (useful for debugging), add this line
to ~/.xinitrc:

    exec i3 -V >> ~/.i3/i3log 2>&1

If you use the Nvidia binary driver <302.17 you need to add the
--force-xinerama flag to ~/.xinitrc. A detailed explanation can be found
at i3wm.org.

    exec i3 --force-xinerama

> Status bar

The internal status bar, i3-wsbar, was deprecated and replaced by i3bar
in i3 v4.0.

New method: i3bar

Unlike i3-wsbar, which requires dzen2, i3bar does not have any
dependencies other than i3-wm. It can be used to view information
generated by conky or i3status. For example (as of version 4.1):

    ~/.i3/config

    bar {
        output            LVDS1
        status_command    i3status
        position          top
        mode              hide
        workspace_buttons yes
        tray_output       none
        
        font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1

        colors {
            background #000000
            statusline #ffffff

            focused_workspace  #ffffff #285577
            active_workspace   #ffffff #333333
            inactive_workspace #888888 #222222
            urgent_workspace   #ffffff #900000
        }
    }

For further information see the Configuring i3bar section of the
official User Guide.

Comparison of i3bar and dzen2

This comparison of i3bar and dzen2 only takes into account how well the
two programs can handle the input from conky or i3status.

  Program   Color Codes   Formatting          Special Fonts    Dock                    Trayer
  --------- ------------- ------------------- ---------------- ----------------------- --------
  i3bar     Yes           No, right aligned   No (UTF8 only)   Yes                     Yes
  dzen2     Yes           No, left aligned    Yes              Yes (the svn version)   No

Though development of i3bar is very active and support for custom
formatting and fonts has been announced, dzen2-svn has an edge over
i3bar (as of August 7th).

Alternatives

-   i3pystatus - extensible i3status replacement with many modules and
    very flexible configuration. Multi-threaded and lock-up free.
-   py3status – an extensible i3status wrapper written in python

> Quickly jumping to open window

-   quickswitch-for-i3 – A Python utility to quickly change to and
    locate windows in i3
-   i3-wm-scripts – search for and jump to windows with particular names
    matching regexp
-   winmenupy launches dmenu with a list of clients, sorted after
    workspaces. Selecting a client jumps to that window.

Suspending with i3lock
----------------------

You need to add unit file below and enable it with
# systemctl enable suspend@<user>.service.

    /etc/systemd/system/suspend@.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Starts i3lock at suspend time
    Before=sleep.target

    [Service]
    User=%I
    Type=forking
    Environment=DISPLAY=:0
    ExecStartPre= 
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/i3lock

    [Install]
    WantedBy=sleep.target

Usage
-----

See the official documentation on this subject for more information: i3
User’s Guide

i3 currently uses dmenu as a application launcher, which is bound by
default to Mod1+d.

> Clipboard (copy & paste issues)

By default, when you close a window, the buffer with the clipboard info
will dissapear. You have to use a clipboard manager like "Parcellite" to
avoid that.
