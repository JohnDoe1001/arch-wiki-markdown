ttytter Not another Twitter client! Yes, another Twitter client. The
difference here is that you're dealing with a multi-functional, fully
100% text, Perl command line client.

  
 tytter is a twitter client for the command line

ttytter

When you start TTYtter without a keyfile, which will be the case the
first time you run it, it will automatically

start an assistant to help you create the keyfile. You only need to
create the keyfile once for each account. It will never expire.

TTYtter will find where your cURL is located, and if successful, you
should see something like this:

ttyter launch image

Once installed simply type

    ttytter -dostream

into your command line and it will prompt you for the Oauth key, click
the given URL

and type in the key which appears in your browser.

Now you should see your twitter timeline in the shell.

Note: If you use this screen name on other machines you use TTYtter on,
simply copy the keyfile there

To enable ANSI colours and some other features here is a template
.ttytterrc which should suffice for most users

.ttytterrc create this file in your home dir and restart ttytter to see
the differences.
