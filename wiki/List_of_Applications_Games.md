you can't see the health bar anymore. Email Michael from

could fully enjoy this game on Linux netbooks

> Emulators

An emulator is a program which serves to replicate the functions of
another platform or system so as to allow applications and games to be
run in environments they were not programmed for. While emulators
themselves are not games in a strict sense, they provide users with the
ability to play games and therefore have been included in this article.

Note:For possibly more up to date selection of emulators, try checking
the AUR 'emulators' category

Warning:Owning an emulator itself is not illegal, but
downloading/sharing copyrighted ROMs and using emulator to run them
without the copyright holder's permission is ILLEGAL. Arch Linux etc. is
not responsible if you get in trouble.
