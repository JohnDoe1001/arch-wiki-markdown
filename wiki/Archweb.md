> Development Plans

-   Get merged site repository somewhere public
-   Finish up any issues with merging of dev/pub sites
    -   <s>Ensure public can't access things they shouldn't
    -   Developer preview site hosted somewhere?

-   Figure out deployment plan for "new" site
    -   What do we do for HTTP vs. HTTPS

-   South integration (http://south.aeracode.org/)
    -   Ismael was planning on looking at this
