Help:Discussion
===============

Discussion or "talk" pages are for communicating with other ArchWiki
users. To discuss any page, go to that page and then click the
"discussion" tab at the top of the page. Experiment by editing the talk
page of the Sandbox.

Starting a new discussion
-------------------------

Add a new discussion at the bottom of a discussion page with a proper
heading. See Help:Style#Section_headings. You can also make use of the +
tab at the top of each discussion page.

If the discussion page does not exist yet, create it.

What does not belong
--------------------

A discussion or talk page is used for discussing subjects relevant to
the article in question.

With that in mind, please do not:

-   Add an edit summary to the discussion page.
    -   There is an editing summary line available on the edit screen
        specifically for this type of information. See Help:Style#Edit
        summary.
-   Ask for help.
    -   Please use the forums or the chat room for this kind of request.
-   Categorize a discussion page.
    -   See Help:Style#Categories

Join a discussion
-----------------

-   Add a new comment at the end of the page or reply below an existing
    comment.
-   Use colons to indent and format your discussion. Standard practice
    is to indent your reply one more level deep than the person to whom
    you are replying. Further, you should insert your comment beneath
    the one to which you are replying, but below others who are doing
    the same.
-   Sign comments by typing ~~~~ to insert your username and a
    timestamp. Avoid editing another user's comments.
-   Do not edit your posts if somebody has already replied, otherwise
    you will break the flow of the discussion and make it difficult for
    others to further respond. Only striking (using <s> tags) words or
    sentences is allowed, but the related explanation should be given in
    a regular reply.
-   It is possible to split a discussion in order to reply to different
    parts of a post separately, but you will have to copy the signature
    of the split post at the end of every resulting section.

Close discussions
-----------------

You should take care to strike the header of exhausted discussions using
<s> tags.

Exhausted discussions will be deleted a while after striking.

An explanation is not mandatory in talk pages, where the why should be
already evident.   
 When deleting exhausted discussions, however, some explanation words
are required (e.g. "closed discussion," "fixed," etc.) and including
also the title of the discussion could help retrieving it in the history
in case it needs to be reopened.

User talk pages
---------------

Note the difference between a user page, and a user talk page. Everyone
may have a user talk page on which other people can leave public
messages. If one does not exist for a particular user, you may create it
so that you can leave a comment. If someone has left you a message on
yours, you will see a note saying "You have new messages" with a link to
your own user talk page: in this case you are supposed to reply on your
own talk page beneath the original message with appropriate indentation.
Please avoid replying to a discussion on a different talk page, for
example the one of the user who contacted you, since such a style of
communication creates disconnects with the flow of information regarding
the subject at hand.

Do not edit a user's own page without permission (i.e. [[User:Name]]);
these serve as personal user spaces. The "user talk page" is the correct
place for communicating (other than sending private email if the address
is published).
