Cedega is a fork of Wine. It is distributed under two licenses:

-   The official build, which you must sign up for $5 per month for a
    minimum of 3 months and you will be given access to Cedega releases
    for the duration of your membership.
-   The unofficial CVS version, which is free, but has worse support for
    games due to commercial parts being stripped for distribution.

This article will detail installing the official build of Cedega. For
the CVS version, see CVSCedega.

Installing Cedega
-----------------

Install cedega from the AUR.

Alternatively, on 64-bit systems, install bin32-cedega from the AUR.
