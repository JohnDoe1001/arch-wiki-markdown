                           deletion.                
                           Reason: This page was    
                           used to report spammers, 
                           but now it's useless,    
                           and ArchWiki:Reports,    
                           ArchWiki                 
                           talk:Administrators or   
                           an admin's talk page     
                           should be used. Blocked  
                           accounts are listed in   
                           Special:BlockList. It's  
                           better to redirect this  
                           title to                 
                           ArchWiki:Reports.

To facilitate administration, everyone is invited to list users that
post spam or otherwise vandalize the wiki in the format of:

    * [[Special:Contributions/<SPAMMER>|<SPAMMER>]]

This results in a link where all contributions of that nick can be
easily accessed:

-   Hellwoofa

As it is clear that this is only a temporary solution, confer to the
(not so) current discussion in the forums for a long-term solution that
is still to be found.

The list
--------

Blocked spam accounts should be deleted from time to time to keep
everything neat.
