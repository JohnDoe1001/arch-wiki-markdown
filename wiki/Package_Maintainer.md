The role of the package maintainer is to update packages as new versions
become available upstream and to field support questions relating to
bugs in said packages. The term may be applied to any of the following:

-   A core Arch Linux developer who maintains a software package in one
    of the official repositories (core, extra, or testing).
-   A Trusted User of the community who maintains software packages in
    the unsupported/unofficial community repository.
-   A normal user who maintains a PKGBUILD and local source files in the
    AUR.

The maintainer of a package is the person currently responsible for the
package. Previous maintainers should be listed as contributors in the
PKGBUILD along with others who have contributed to the package.
