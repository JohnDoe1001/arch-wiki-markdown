Software Access Point
=====================

  
 A software access point is used when you want your computer to act as
an wifi access point for the local wireless network. It saves you the
trouble of getting a separate wireless router.

Requirements
------------

-   A nl80211 compatible wireless device (e.g. ath9k)

Overview
--------

Setting up an access point comprises two main parts:

-   Setting up the wifi link layer, so that wireless clients can
    associate to your computer's "software access point" and
    send/receive IP packets from/to your computer; this is what the
    hostapd package will do for you
-   Setting up the network configuration on you computer, so that your
    computer will properly relay IP packets from/to its own Internet
    connection from/to wireless clients.

Wifi Link Layer
---------------

The actual Wifi link is established via the hostapd package. That
package is compatible with WPA2.

Install the hostapd package from the official repositories.

Create the config file of hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.

Adjust the options as necessary. Especially, change the ssid and the
wpa_passphrase.

    /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

    ssid=YourWifiName
    wpa_passphrase=Somepassphrase
    interface=wlan0
    bridge=br0
    auth_algs=3
    channel=7
    driver=nl80211
    hw_mode=g
    logger_stdout=-1
    logger_stdout_level=2
    max_num_sta=5
    rsn_pairwise=CCMP
    wpa=2
    wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP

For automatically starting hostapd, enable the hostapd.service.

Network configuration
---------------------

There are two basic ways for implementing this:

1.  bridge: create a network bridge on your computer (wireless clients
    will appear to access the same network interface and the same subnet
    that's used by your computer)
2.  NAT: with IP forwarding/masquerading and DHCP service (wireless
    clients will use a dedicated subnet, data from/to that subnet is
    NAT-ted -- similar to a normal WiFi router that's connected to your
    DSL or cable modem)

The bridge approach is more simple, but it requires that any service
that's needed by your wireless clients (like, DHCP) is available on your
computers external interface. That means it will not work if you have a
dialup connection (e.g., via PPPoE or a 3G modem) or if you're using a
cable modem that will supply exactly one IP address to you via DHCP.

The NAT aproach is more versatile, as it clearly separates wifi clients
from your computer and it's completely transparent to the outside world.
It will work with any kind of network connection, and (if needed) you
can introduce traffic policies using the usual iptables approach.

Of course, is possible to combine both things. For that, studying both
articles would be necessary. (Example: Like having a bridge that
contains both an ethernet device and the wireless device with an static
ip, offering DHCP and setting NAT configured to relay the traffic to an
additional network device - that can be ppp or eth)

> Bridge Setup

See Bridge with netcfg for details.

Note that, you should not add the wireless device (like wlan0) to the
bridge; hostapd will add it on its own.

> NAT Setup

See Internet Share for details.

On that article, the device connected to the lan is net0. That device
would be in this case your wireless device (which probably is wlan0).

Troubleshooting
---------------

> WLAN is very slow

This could be caused by low entropy. Consider installing haveged.

> NetworkManager is interfering

hostapd may not work, if the device is managed by NetworkManager. You
can mask the device by adding

    [keyfile]
    unmanaged-devices=mac:<hwaddr>

to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
