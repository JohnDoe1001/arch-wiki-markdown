Aegis Project
-------------

The goal of the Arch Environmental/Geographical Information Systems
(Arch EGIS) project was to increase awareness of and accessibility to
the very latest, free, open-source GIS applications, sample data and
other useful geographical and statistical tools, through the development
of an Open Source GIS toolkit.

Archie
------

Archie was a complete live Arch linux system run from a CD/USB-stick,
built with the KISS philosophy in mind. It provided a full Arch linux
system, yet it delivered fast performance without extensive bloating.
Archie used its own hw-detection tool, lshwd, to support a wide range of
hardware with fast detection time. Archie also provided extended
features such as multiple languages, nesting capabilities, and
hd-install.

ArchLinux PPC
-------------

"The goal of the Archlinux PPC porting project is to make our favourite
distribution, Arch Linux, available for the PPC architecture. Our strong
community is diverse and helpful, and we pride ourselves on the range of
skillsets and uses for Arch that stem from it. Please check out the
forums and mailing list to get your feet wet. Also glance through the
wiki if you want to learn more about Arch."

archlive-i586
-------------

Arch Linux is an i686 optimized distribution, but sometimes members of
the community ask how to install it on VIA C3 (mini-itx systems) or AMD
Geode based systems. Since these CPUs are not fully i686 compatible,
there is the need for an i586 port. There have been some past attempts
to create an i586 port of Arch Linux. Some were successful, but they are
not maintained anymore. The goal of archlive-i586 is to have an up to
date i586 installation CD, with a reasonably sized package repository
with at least 4-5 mirrors.

Borderless Linux
----------------

"I'm the founder of Borderless Linux. I am pleased to announce that we
in fact are merging into what is currently the Chakra Project. We will
be creating a LiveCD based upon Chakra's configurations and
optimizations, but with a GNOME GUI. We will be using Larch to build the
CD and hope to provide all the same functionality as Chakra, except
using GNOME."

ConnochaetOS
------------

"ConnochaetOS will be a free operating system for the desktop with old
computers in mind but with modern software. ConnochaetOS will contain
only free software, according to the GNU Guidelines for Free System
Distributions, follow the KISS principle (Keep it small and simple),
need as few resources as possible, be modern, but stable. We aim for
minimal hardware requirements, as low as a Pentium I processor and 64 MB
RAM for a graphical desktop. We decided to base ConnochaetOS on Arch
Linux, but completely rebuild, since we want to support i586, and
replace some packages with our own ones, because of footprint, stability
or freedom."

FaunOS was a portable, fully integrated Linux operating system with over
600 pre-installed packages. Based on Arch Linux, it was specifically
designed to run from a portable USB memory device (such as a USB Flash

DVD, and even the internal hard drive. FaunOS was a live desktop system
designed to run without setup on most modern x86-based systems.

low-end systems.

March Linux
-----------

March Linux aimed to be a simple, lean and fast GNU/Linux distribution
for the desktop, which urged the users to learn Linux instead of holding
their hands at every step. At the same time, it was usable and fully
functional with a generous package choices. While it was heavily based
on Arch Linux, the author prefered to call March an Arch "distrolet".
The default desktop environment in March Linux was Fluxbox.

Maryan Linux 2
--------------

The Maryan Linux 2 Project is designed to enable older hardware to run a
fast and beautiful dekstop. For this reason, Maryan uses Enlightenment
17, which is a lightweight and very visually appealing desktop
environment. The Maryan Linux developers strongly believe that this
desktop environment is mature, stable (most of the time), and one of the
most efficient for minimal computer resources usage.

Shift Linux
-----------

Shift Linux was a work in progress that aimed to be a desktop distro
based on a solid Arch foundation. As of May 8th, 2009, development
ceased. Read more about it here:

"Anyone interested in developing a Linux distro should consider helping
out Firefly Linux. It's a great project that spawned from Shift."

UKnow4Kids
----------

The UKnow4Kids Live DVD is a Linux distribution compiling educational
software for children 2- to 10-years-old. The distribution is intended
for broad usage by a non-technical audience (regular parents).
Development stalled in mid 2010.

-   Uses Arch Linux as the core, LXDE/OpenBox as the window manager,
    SLiM as the display manager, and mastered using gradgrind's Larch
    scripts.
-   It is essentially indestructible for children's use, and it is
    impossible for the hard drive of the host PC to be affected when the
    live CD is running.
-   Runs well on old Intel hardware, so it should run fine on a Pentium
    II with 256 MB RAM (that's what my kid uses) or better.
-   Provides a familiar Windows-like/Mac-like user experience, requiring
    only minimal computer experience to run.
