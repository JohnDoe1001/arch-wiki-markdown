Installation
------------

There are currently two versions of Gambas: Gambas 3 and the older
Gambas 2.

Note:Gambas consists of a runtime and IDE further broken up into several
distinct components. Not all of them may be needed for what you wish to
do with the IDE or for running a specific Gambas application.

> Gambas 3

Gambas 3 is the latest version of the language, and is distinct from
earlier versions of Gambas although most projects can be converted and
ran on the latest version.

To install the latest stable version of Gambas 3, install the gambas3
package from the official repositories. Development versions can be
grabbed by installing the gambas3-svn package from the AUR.

> Gambas 2

To install the latest version of Gambas 2, install the gambas2 package
from the official repositories.

Gambas 2 will happily run alongside Gambas 3.

Tips and tricks
---------------

Gambas 3 can build installation packages for various distributions and
has support for building Arch packages, perfect for use with the AUR.

Gambas supports both the GTK+ and QT toolkits and can make use of both,
allowing the application to fit seamlessly into most Desktop
environments. This also applies to applications made inside the Gambas
IDE, assuming the gb3-gui component is used.
