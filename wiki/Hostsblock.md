hostsblock is a bash script for Linux designed to take advantage of the
HOSTS file available in all operating systems to provide system-wide
blocking of internet advertisements, malicious domains, trackers, and
other undesirable content. To do so, it downloads a configurable set of
blocklists and processes and their entries into a singular HOSTS file.
