PCNTL is a PHP extension that cannot be loaded like other more
convenient extension. This is because of the great power it gives to
PHP. PCNTL allows you to create process directly into the server side
machine. While this may seen as something you would want, it also gives
the power to PHP to mess things up really bad.

To enable (By default is not enable) this extension PCNTL has to be
compiled into PHP. For this situation arch provides several tools which
users who use AUR services may be familiar.

Tools: makepkg abs
