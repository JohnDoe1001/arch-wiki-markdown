Zepto Znote 6214W
=================

The Zepto Znote 6214W is a nice laptop, or rather a really small and
light desktop replacement. It is build upon the Intel NAPA platform with
i945PM Chipset, Core Duo CPU and ipw3945 wireless. Remember to update
the BIOS on
[ftp.zepto.dk/Firmware/Bios/6214W|ftp.zepto.dk/Firmware/Bios/6214W].

What does work?
---------------

-   3D Acceleration using the latest nvidia driver.
-   Wireless using ipw3945.
-   Wired network using r1000 (included in arch stock kernel).
-   Suspend to swap. though it was really slow to suspend.

20/2-07:Texas Instrument card reader works, some drivers are loaded but
to make the card reader working just add tifm_sd in the module section
from rc.conf.

20/2-07:TV output is fine with nvidia driver and an appropriate
xorg.conf, either dual screen or twinview mode.

These worked for me nearly ootb

    Frequency-Scaling with acpi-cpufreq
    Tv-Out
    Bluetooth 

> Not tested

Texas Intrument card reader, there's currently a developement running to
make it work here and here

Installation
------------

Installation is straigt forward. You might have to select IDE-Legacy in
the first GRUB menu, otherwise you might get a kernel panic. Drivers for
the wired and wireless network cards are included.

Configurations
--------------

> Kernel boot options

Boot the kernel with noapic because the BIOS is a little buggy. This
prevents random freezes when watching DVD's, gaming etc.

> rc.conf

  [Tango-dialog-warning.pn This article or section  [Tango-dialog-warning.pn
  g]                       is out of date.          g]
                           Reason: There is no more 
                           rc.conf. (Discuss)       
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

My MODULES looks like this:

    MODULES=(!ata_piix ahciÂ !hw_random r1000 ipw3945)

This makes sure eth1 is wired network and eth2 is wireless. The
hw_random module seems to fail on this laptop so I blacklist it.

Graphic card and Xorg
---------------------

This laptop has a GeForce Go 7600 graphic card and works only with the
proprietary nvidia driver (or vesa). Native resolution is only possible
with the nvidia driver.

The monitor runs at 1280x768 60Hz, so remember to add "1280x768" to
Modes

Wireless
--------

Wireless should work out of the box. See Wireless network
configuration#Setup_and_Boot wireless setup for additional information
on wireless networking.

Sound
-----

The sound will work out of the box, make sure you have alsa-lib and
alsa-utils packages installed, and add yourself to audio group.

As of kernel 2.6.26 you might not be able to adjust the PCM volume, as
there is no slider. You can workaround this with setting the following
in your /etc/modprobe.d/sound

    options snd-hda-intel model=lenovo enable=1 index=0
    alias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel
    alias sound-slot-0 snd-hda-intel

To get volume hotkeys to work create ~/.Xmodmap with:

    keycode 160 = XF86AudioMute 
    keycode 174 = XF86AudioLowerVolume
    keycode 176 = XF86AudioRaiseVolume

(If you use openbox do not forget to map the XF86xxxxxx keys in rc.xml)
