============

From Getting Started with TeX, LaTeX, and Friends:

TeX is a typesetting language. Instead of visually formatting your text,
you enter your manuscript text intertwined with TeX commands in a plain
text file. You then run TeX to produce formatted output, such as a PDF
file. Thus, in contrast to standard word processors, your document is a
separate file that does not pretend to be a representation of the final
typeset output, and so can be easily edited and manipulated.

TeX itself is only one component of what many consider to be a complete
TeX distribution. For example, there exist a number of macro packages
(also known as TeX formats) such as LaTeX and Plain TeX that simplify
TeX applications at the cost of flexibility. Internally, TeX makes use
of Metafont to define the shapes of glyphs and the relations between
them.

TeX Live is a complete and comprehensive TeX distribution available in
the official repositories that includes all the major TeX-related
programs, macro packages, and fonts. The older (discontinued) teTeX
distribution is available in the AUR.
