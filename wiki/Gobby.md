Gobby
=====

From the project web page:

Gobby is a free collaborative editor supporting multiple documents in
one session and a multi-user chat. It uses GTK+ 2.6 as its windowing
toolkit and thus integrates nicely into the GNOME desktop environment.

Installation
------------

Gobby .4 is in the community repo as package gobby.

The newer development version .5 (0.4.94-1 at the time of writing) is
available in AUR as package gobby-dev

Usage
-----

To start the server portion, run

    /usr/bin/infinoted-0.5 --security-policy=no-tls

The server only needs to be running on one machine.

Then, run the gobby client and connect to the server via IP or
localhost.

If youâ€™d rather have encryption, TLS is available. Use:

    infinoted --create-key --create-certificate -k key.pem  -c cert.pem

The keys creation is automatic, and you can launch the server just
using:

    infinoted -k key.pem  -c cert.pem
