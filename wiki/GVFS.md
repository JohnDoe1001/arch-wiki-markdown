GVFS is the virtual filesystem for the GNOME desktop, which allows
mounting local and remote filesystems as a user along with trash
support. It is also used by file managers like Thunar.

Installation
------------

The gvfs package needs to be installed, along with a suitable polkit
authentication agent.

GVFS without root password
--------------------------

In file managers (e.g. Thunar), when you try to mount a drive, you might
see that you need to enter the root password to continue every single
time you want to mount and unmount a drive. This can be bypassed by
setting a polkit rule as shown in Polkit#Allow mounting a filesystem on
a system device.
