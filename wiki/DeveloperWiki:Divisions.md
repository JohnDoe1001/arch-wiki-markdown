This article is part of the DeveloperWiki.

Foundation Division
===================

Purpose
-------

The Foundation division will decide what direction Arch Linux as a whole
will go. They will choose to enact proposed divisions, be in
communication with the leads of all groups below them, and address any
disputes among divisions and developers.

will be marked with a [FND] at the beginning of the subject line.

documentation_ while _asserting common layout standards_, and
_maintaining specific core documents_ like the installation guide and
mission statement.

be responsible for developing and maintaining the AUR as well as
managing the relationship between developers, TUs, and the community of
users at large. It would be responsible for ensuring effective
bidirectional communication between the development team and the rest of
the community, taking advantage of the substantial contributions the
user community has to offer, while also maintaining and communicating
the guidelines the community members should follow.
