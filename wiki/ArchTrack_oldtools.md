NOTE: The following list of tools is included to support ongoing
development of AUR packages for these tools. In the near future, it will
be automatically generated by the script(s) at the ArchTrack project at
GitHub. Please be patient! There are only a few people working on this
in a part-time, unofficial capacity.

Information Gathering
---------------------

tool

status

info

ASS(T)

irpas

ASS is a Autonomous System Scanner. Because routing protocols use
autonomous systems to distinguish between various routing "domains" and
various ways to communicate, you need something which works like a TCP
port scanner but knows more than one protocol.

Dmitry(T)

dmitry

DMitry (Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool) is a UNIX/Linux command
line program coded purely in C with the ability to gather as much
information as possible about a host.

DNS-Ptr(T)

TODO

It is a tool that allows you to make a consultation by means of IP ranks
to obtain DNS names of this IPs in addition with simplicity and speed.

dnswalk(T)

dnswalk

Dnswalk is a DNS debugger. It performs zone transfers of specified

domains, and checks the database in numerous ways for internal
consistency, as well as accuracy.

dns-bruteforce(T)

TODO

This tool is used to made a brute force on name resolution.The idea of
that tool is to resolve all words dot domain name. To be more useful the
tool uses multi threading; one thread for each name server. Classical
brute forcers are sequential. With this method we cut the dictionary in
n blocs ( n is the number of dns servers) and distribute these blocs to
name servers.

The tool is now in the project revhosts, new updates are only available
in revhosts.

dnsenum(T)

TODO

A tool written in Perl to enumerate information on a domain. It uses the
Net::DNS module.

dnsmap(T)

dnsmap

Dnsmap is a small C based tool that perform brute-forcing of domains.
The tool can use an internal wordlist, or work with an external
dictionary file.

DNSPredictx(T)

TODO

This PERL script, by Jimmy Neutron, is great for determining DNS names
with Google. This tool, which is essential for network mapping, accepts
two somewhat related words, and a domain name as arguments. The two
words are sent through Google sets which expands the words into a list
of related words. For example, "earth" and "mars" would expand to Venus,
Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Pluto. If fed domain foo.com,
dnspredict would then attempt to DNS resolve venus.foo.com,
mercury.foo.com, etc. This Windows version is standalone, and requires
nothing other than this executable.

dnstracer(T)

dnstracer

FingerGoogle(T)

TODO

FingerGoogle is a reduced Net-Twister module that helps to find user
account names

Firewalk(T)

firewalk

Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts
to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will
pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one
greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it
will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and
elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway host does not allow
the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will
see no response.

Goog Mail Enum(T)

TODO

Enumerate domain emails from google

Google search(T)

TODO

Google search script from the command line.

Googrape(T)

TODO

Gives a localized access to the Google Hacking DB by allowing you to
look up a domain name. And is excelent for searching through records.

Gooscan(T)

TODO

Gooscan is a tool that automates queries against Google search
appliances.

Host(T)

dnsutils

host is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used
to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or
options are given, host prints a short summary of its command line
arguments and options.

For greater information: "man host"

Itrace(T)

irpas

Itrace is a program that implements traceroute(1) functionality using
ICMP echo request packets. Therefore, it looks like you are just pinging
your target while you traceroute there. It often helps tracing behind
firewalls.

Netenum(T)

irpas

netenum can be used to produce lists of hosts for other programs. It's
not as powerful as other ping-sweep tools, but it's simple. When giving
a timeout, it uses ICMP echo request to find available hosts. If you
don't supply a timeout, it just prints an IP address per line, so you
can use them in shell scripts.

Netmask(T)

irpas

netmask asks for the netmask by ICMP.

PIRANA(T)

TODO

PIRANA is a penetration testing framework to help in checking a SMTP
content filter's security. It works by attaching an exploit to an email,
optionally disguising it from content filters. PIRANA also lets you
choose from different type of shellcodes to use and has various options
to be stealthy.

Notes: The manual page incorrectly shows an EXAMPLES entry using the -l
(ell) option as a -1 (one). The -l (ell) option is correct. You'll need
to specify a fully qualified email address (user@example.com) instead of
just the user name. Run make in the /pentest/fuzzers/pirana directory
before using PIRANA.

"I wrote a paper that explains what are the vulnerabilities of a SMTP
content filter. It also presents what techniques were used in PIRANA to
improve reliability and stealthness." Jean-SÃ©bastien Guay-Leroux, Author
of Pirana tool

Protos(T)

irpas*

Protos is a IP protocol scanner. It goes through all possible IP
protocols and uses a negative scan to sort out unsupported protocols
which should be reported by the target using ICMP protocol unreachable
messages.

QGoogle(T)

TODO

Make google queries from python. Google licence key required.

Relay Scanner(T)

TODO

It can search for SMTP server also locates and identifies open relay
SMTP servers. It is an all in one program, you tell it how to scan and
it does ALL of the work for you.

SMTP-Vrfy(T)

TODO

An SMTP Protocol Hacker.

Vrfy.pl uses the vrfy command to verify users/mail accounts on a network
by using a list of common system names like root, admin, etc...

TCtrace(T)

irpas*

TCtrace is like itrace a traceroute(1) brother - but it uses TCP SYN
packets to trace. This makes it possible for you to trace through
firewalls if you know one TCP service that is allowed to pass from the
outside.

Network Mapping
---------------

tool

status

info

Amap 5.2(T)

irpas

Kond:Network Mapping

Autoscan 0.99R1(G)

autoscan*

AutoScan is an application designed to explore and to manage your
network. Entire subnets can be scanned simultaneously without human
intervention.

Fping(T)

fping

Fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up. fping is
different from ping in that you can specify any number of hosts on the
command line, or specify a file containing the lists of hosts to ping.
Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or replies, fping will send
out a ping packet and move on to the next host in a round-robin fashion.
If a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of hosts to
check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or
retry limit it will be considered unreachable.

Hping(T)

hping

hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The
interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only
able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP
protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a
covered channel, and many other features.

IKE-Scan(T)

TODO

ike-scan is a command-line tool that uses the IKE protocol to discover,
fingerprint and test IPsec VPN servers.

IKEProbe(T)

TODO

IKEProbe can be used to determine vulnerabilities in the PSK
implementation of the VPN server. It tries out various combinations of
ciphers, hashes and Diffie-Helman groups and attempts to force the
remote server into aggressive mode. Tutorial using IKEprobe:
http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1821

Netdiscover(T)

netdiscover

Netdiscover is an active/passive address reconnaissance tool, mainly
developed for those wireless networks without dhcp server, when you are
wardriving. It can be also used on hub/switched networks.

Netselect(T)(*)

netselect

An ultrafast intelligent parallelizing binary-search implementation of
ping.

Nmap 5(T)

nmap*

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source tool for network exploration
and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,
although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in
novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what
services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what
operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of
packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many
systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such
as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring
host or service uptime.

Nmap tutorial:

PSK-Crack(T)

TODO

psk-crack attempts to crack IKE Aggressive Mode pre-shared keys that
have been previously gathered using ike-scan with the --pskcrack option.

psk-crack can operate in two different modes:

- Dictionary cracking mode: this is the default mode in which psk-crack
tries each candidate word from the dictionary file in turn until it
finds a match, or all the words in the dictionary have been tried.

- Brute-force cracking mode: in this mode, psk-crack tries all possible
combinations of a specified character set up to a given length.

Ping(T)

iputils

The ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST
datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by
a ``struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of ``padbytes used to
fill out the packet.

Protos(T)

irpas

Protos is a IP protocol scanner. It goes through all possible IP
protocols and uses a negative scan to sort out unsupported protocols
which should be reported by the target using ICMP protocol unreachable
messages.

Scanrand(T)

paketto

Scanrand is a fast network scanner that can scan single hosts to very
large networks efficiently. However, several network mapping utilites
boast this same claim. So why is scanrand any different? Scanrand can do
what is called stateless TCP scanning, which sets it apart from the
other network scanners.

umit(T)

TODO

testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy
passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail,
files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception
of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to
layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active
monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions
by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.

EtherApe(G)

httprint

httprint is a web server fingerprinting tool. It relies on web server
characteristics to accurately identify web servers. Normally by changing
server signatures and banner strings or enabling specific plug-ins,
various web fingerprinting tools may be confused and provide false
positive results. This is not the case with httprint. httprint can also
be used to detect web enabled devices which do not have a server banner
string, such as: Wireless AP, Routers, Switches, Cable modems, etc.
httprint uses text based signature strings to identify targeted web
servers.

TNScmd(T)

TODO

tnscmd can be used to speak, on a very simple level, with Oracle's TNS
listener.

The TNS listener (aka tnslsnr) is the network interface between a
database client and the database server. tnslsnr listens on port
1521/tcp, but the DBA can change this (I've seen listeners on port
1541/tcp as well.) fwiw, nmap-services lists these as ncube-lm and rds2,
respectively.

The tnslnsr keeps a spartan log of activity -- spartan in that it
doesn't log a whole lot of useful information. For instance, it does not
log the IP address of TNS sessions.

If you initiate a TCP session to the tnslsnr port, you won't make much
headway; it won't provide a banner and will probably disconnect if you
type something. Don't worry; this is what tnscmd is for.

Kismet is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and

intrusion detection system. Kismet will work with any wireless card
which supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and can sniff 802.11b,
802.11a, and 802.11g traffic. Kismet identifies networks by passively
collecting packets and detecting standard named networks, detecting (and
given time, decloaking) hidden networks, and infering the presence of
nonbeaconing networks via data traffic.

Pcapsipdump(GT)

TODO?

Pcapsipdump is a tool for dumping (recording) SIP sessions (and RTP
traffic, if available) to disk in a fashion similar to "tcpdump -w" (the
format is exactly the same).

The difference is that the data is saved with one file per SIP session.
Even if there are thousands of concurrect SIP sessions, each goes to
separate file.

PcapToSip_RTP(GT)

TODO?

This program with full C# source code allows you to dump the calls
captured from Tetheral, Ethereal, Wireshark, and TCPDUMP. You will have
the sound files to play Incoming, Outgoing, and Combined audio.

Sipsak(GT)

TODO?

Sipsak is a small command line tool for developers and administrators of
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications. It can be used for some
simple tests on SIP applications and devices.

SIPcrack(GT)

sipcrack

SIPcrack is a SIP login sniffer/cracker that contains 2 programs:
sipdump to capture the digest authentication and sipcrack to bruteforce
the hash using a wordlist or standard input.

Sipp is a performance testing tool for the SIP protocol. It includes a
few basic SipStone user agent scenarios (UAC & UAS) and establishes and
releases multiple calls with the INVITE and BYE methods. It also reads
XML scenario files describing any performance testing configuration. It
features the dynamic display of statistics about running tests, periodic
CSV statistics dumps, TCP, UDP, or TLS over IPv4 or IPv6 over multiple
sockets or multiplexed with retransmission management, regular
expressions and variables in scenario files, conditional branching, and
dynamically-adjustable call rates. RTP play (voice, video, and RFC2833
DTMFs) is also supported.

All in 1(T)

TODO?

This tool should help you to make several time consuming tasks in
Sleuthkit/autopsy in one row:

-   Extract unallocted space
-   Extract strings (ASCII and Unicode) from allocated and unallocated
-   Sort by file types
-   Sort by images and create thumbnails
-   Make foremost run on images
-   Scheduling

All this steps are also saved in the host.aut-file so Autopsy will know
about what happened.

Autopsy(G)

autopsy

The Autopsy Forensic Browser is a graphical interface to the command
line digital investigation tools in The Sleuth Kit. Together, they allow
you to investigate the file system and volumes of a computer.

dcfldd(T)

dcfldd

dcfldd is an enhanced version of GNU dd with features useful for
forensics and security.

DD_Rescue(T)

TODO?

dd_rescue copies data from one file or block device to another. It is
intended for error recovery, so, by default, it doesn't abort on errors,
and doesn't truncate the output file. It uses large block sizes to
quicken the copying, but falls back to small blocks upon encountering
errors. It produces reports that allow you to keep track of bad blocks.

Foremost(T)

foremost

Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers,
footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred
to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those
generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The
headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can
use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in
types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a
more reliable and faster recovery.

Magic Rescue(T)

TODO?

Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover
and calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes"
in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and for
recovering a corrupted drive or partition. As long as the file data is
there, it will find it.

It works on any file system, but on very fragmented file systems it can
only recover the first chunk of each file. Practical experience (this
program was not written for fun) shows, however, that chunks of 30-50MB
are not uncommon.

mboxgrep(T)

TODO?

mboxgrep is a small utility that scans a mailbox for messages matching a
regular expression. Found messages can be either displayed on standard
output, counted, deleted, piped to a shell command or written to another
mailbox.

mdd

Memfetch(T)

TODO?

Memfetch is a yet another small but useful security tool that allows
instant and non-intrusive dumping of ALL process memory, including the
information absent from core files. This is a neat way to see what,
exactly, is running at a particular PID.

Memfetch Find(T)

TODO?

Custom perl script that can be used to find strings (regular expression
matches) in memfetch dump files in a more useful way then grep could -
that is, finding exact memory locations.

Pasco(T)

GDB GNU Debugger(GT)

gdb

GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on
`inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program
was doing at the moment it crashed. The program being debugged can be
written in Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, Pascal (and many other languages).
Those programs might be executing on the same machine as GDB (native) or
on another machine (remote). GDB can run on most popular UNIX and
Microsoft Windows variants.

GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

1) Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.

2) Make your program stop on specified conditions.

3) Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

4) Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting
the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
