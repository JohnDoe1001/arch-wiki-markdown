Installation
------------

Install the Bluetooth protocol stack bluez and the bluez-utils package
which provides the bluetoothctl utility from the official repositories.
The dbus daemon, which is started automatically by systemd, is used to
read settings and for PIN pairing, while the bluetooth daemon is
required for the Bluetooth protocol.

To start the bluetooth systemd service use the command:

    # systemctl start bluetooth

To enable the bluetooth service at boot time use the command:

    # systemctl enable bluetooth

Note:By default the bluetooth daemon will only give out bnep0 devices to
users that are a member of the lp group. Make sure to add your user to
that group if you intend to connect to a bluetooth tether. You can
change the group that is required in the file
/etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf.

Note:Some Bluetooth adapters are bundled with a Wi-Fi card (e.g. Intel
Centrino). These require that the Wi-Fi card is first enabled (typically
a keyboard shortcut on a laptop) in order to make the Bluetooth adapter
visible to the kernel.

Configuration via the CLI
-------------------------

> Bluetoothctl

Pairing a device from the shell is one of the most simplistic and
reliable options. The exact procedure depends on the devices involved
and their input functionality. What follows is a general outline of
pairing a device using /usr/bin/bluetoothctl:

Start the bluetoothctl interactive command. There one can input help to
get a list of available commands.

-   Turn the power to the controller on by entering power on. It is off
    by default.
-   Enter devices to get the MAC Address of the device with which to
    pair.
-   Enter device discovery mode with scan on command if device is not
    yet on the list.
-   Turn the agent on with agent on.
-   Enter pair MAC Address to do the pairing (tab completion works).
-   If using a device without a PIN, one may need to manually trust the
    device before it can reconnect successfully. Enter trust MAC Address
    to do so.
-   Finally, use connect MAC_address to establish a connection.

An example session may look this way:

    # bluetoothctl 
    [NEW] Controller 00:10:20:30:40:50 pi [default]
    [bluetooth]# agent KeyboardOnly 
    Agent registered
    [bluetooth]# default-agent 
    Default agent request successful
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    Discovery started
    [CHG] Controller 00:10:20:30:40:50 Discovering: yes
    [NEW] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 myLino
    [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 LegacyPairing: yes
    [bluetooth]# pair 00:12:34:56:78:90
    Attempting to pair with 00:12:34:56:78:90
    [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: yes
    [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: no
    [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: yes
    Request PIN code
    [agent] Enter PIN code: 1234
    [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Paired: yes
    Pairing successful
    [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: no

In order to have the device active after a reboot, a udev rule is
needed: /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules

    # Set bluetooth power up
    ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="hci0", RUN+="/usr/bin/hciconfig hci0 up"

After a suspend/resume-cycle, the device can be powered off
automatically using something like this systemd service:

    /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth-auto-power@.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Bluetooth auto power on
    After=bluetooth.service sys-subsystem-bluetooth-devices-%i.device suspend.target

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    #We could also do a 200 char long call to bluez via dbus. Except this does not work since bluez does not react to dbus at this point of the resume sequence and I do not know how I get this service to run at a time it does. So we just ignore bluez and force %i up using hciconfig. Welcome to the 21st century.
    #ExecStart=/usr/bin/dbus-send --system --type=method_call --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/%I org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set string:org.bluez.Adapter1 string:Powered variant:boolean:true
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/hciconfig %i up

    [Install]
    WantedBy=suspend.target

Configuration with a Graphical Front-end
----------------------------------------

The following packages allow for a graphical interface to customize
Bluetooth.

> GNOME Bluetooth

GNOME Bluetooth is a fork of the old bluez-gnome and is focused on
integration with the GNOME desktop environment. The gnome-bluetooth
package provides the back-end, gnome-shell provides the status monitor
applet, and gnome-control-center provides the configuration front-end
GUI that can be accessed by typing Bluetooth on the Activities overview,
or with the gnome-control-center bluetooth command.

Users who are not using GNOME Shell can install
gnome-bluetooth-applet-git from AUR, which provides the old status
monitor applet, and allows setup devices and transfer of files by
clicking the Bluetooth icon. Just make sure that bluetooth-applet is
autostarted with your session.

You can also launch the following commands directly:

-   bluetooth-sendto: send files to a remote device
-   bluetooth-wizard: for new devices to be paired

To add a Bluetooth entry to the SendTo menu in Thunar's file properties
menu, see instructions here. (The command that needs to be configured is
bluetooth-sendtoÂ %F)

> BlueDevil

The Bluetooth tool for KDE is BlueDevil. It can be installed with the
package bluedevil, available in the official repositories.

Make sure bluetooth daemon is running, as described above. A Bluetooth
icon should be visible in both Dolphin and in the system tray, from
which users may configure BlueDevil and detect Bluetooth devices by
clicking the icon. An interface is also available from the KDE System
Settings.

Using Obex for sending and receiving files
------------------------------------------

> ObexFS

Another option, rather than using KDE or Gnome Bluetooth packages, is
ObexFS which allows for the mounting of phones which are treated like
any other filesystem.

Note:To use ObexFS, one needs a device that provides an ObexFTP service.

Install obexfs and mount supported phones by running:

    $ obexfs -b devices_MAC_address /mountpoint

Once you have finished, to unmount the device use the command:

    $ fusermount -u /mountpoint

For more mounting options see
http://dev.zuckschwerdt.org/openobex/wiki/ObexFs

Note:Ensure that the bluetooth device you are mounting is not set to
mount read-only. You should be able to do this from the device's
settings. If the device is mounted read-only you may encounter a
permissions error when trying to transfer files to the device.

> ObexFTP Transfers

If your device supports the Obex FTP service but you do not wish to
mount the device you can transfer files to and from the device using the
obexftp command.

Tip:If you installed obexfs earlier then obexftp should have also been
installed as a dependency.

To send a file to a device run the command:

    $ obexftp -b devices_MAC_address -p /path/to/file

To retrieve a file from a device run the command:

    $ obexftp -b devices_MAC_address -g filename

Note:Ensure that the file you are retrieving is in the device's exchange
folder. If the file is in a subfolder of the exchange folder then
provide the correct path in the command.

> Obex Object Push

For devices that do not support Obex FTP service, check if Obex Object
Push is supported.

    # sdptool browse XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

Read the output, look for Obex Object Push, remember the channel for
this service. If supported, one can use ussp-push to send files to this
device:

    # ussp-push XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX@CHANNEL file wanted_file_name_on_phone

Examples
--------

All examples have been moved to the bluez4 article. They need to be
checked and fixed for use with bluez5.

Troubleshooting
---------------

> gnome-bluetooth

If you see this when trying to enable receiving files in
bluetooth-properties:

    Bluetooth OBEX start failed: Invalid path
    Bluetooth FTP start failed: Invalid path

Then install xdg-user-dirs and issue:

    $ xdg-user-dirs-update

You can edit the paths using:

    $ vi ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs

> Bluetooth USB Dongle

If you are using a USB dongle, you should check that your Bluetooth
dongle is recognized. You can do that by running journalctl -f when
plugging in the USB dongle (or inspecting /var/log/messages.log). It
should look something like the following (look out for hci):

    Feb 20 15:00:24 hostname kernel: [ 2661.349823] usb 4-1: new full-speed USB device number 3 using uhci_hcd
    Feb 20 15:00:24 hostname bluetoothd[4568]: HCI dev 0 registered
    Feb 20 15:00:24 hostname bluetoothd[4568]: Listening for HCI events on hci0
    Feb 20 15:00:25 hostname bluetoothd[4568]: HCI dev 0 up
    Feb 20 15:00:25 hostname bluetoothd[4568]: Adapter /org/bluez/4568/hci0 has been enabled

For a list of supported hardware please refer to the Resource section on
this page.

If you only get the first two lines, you may see that it found the
device but you need to bring it up. Example:

    hciconfig -a hci0

    hci0:	Type: USB
    	BD Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00 ACL MTU: 0:0 SCO MTU: 0:0
    	DOWN 
    	RX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 events:0 errors:0
            TX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 commands:0 errors:

    # hciconfig hci0 up

    hciconfig -a hci0

    hci0:	Type: USB
    	BD Address: 00:02:72:C4:7C:06 ACL MTU: 377:10 SCO MTU: 64:8
    	UP RUNNING 
    	RX bytes:348 acl:0 sco:0 events:11 errors:0
            TX bytes:38 acl:0 sco:0 commands:11 errors:0

If this fails with an error like:

    Operation not possible due to RF-kill

it could be due either to the rfkill utility, in which case it should be
resolved with

    # rfkill unblock all

or, it could simply be the hardware switch of the computer. The hardware
bluetooth switch (at least sometimes) controls access to USB bluetooth
dongles also. Flip/press this switch and try bringing the device up
again.

To verify that the device was detected you can use hcitool which is part
of the bluez-utils. You can get a list of available devices and their
identifiers and their MAC address by issuing:

    $ hcitool dev

    Devices:
            hci0	00:1B:DC:0F:DB:40

More detailed information about the device can be retrieved by using
hciconfig.

    $ hciconfig -a hci0

    hci0:   Type: USB
            BD Address: 00:1B:DC:0F:DB:40 ACL MTU: 310:10 SCO MTU: 64:8
            UP RUNNING PSCAN ISCAN
            RX bytes:1226 acl:0 sco:0 events:27 errors:0
            TX bytes:351 acl:0 sco:0 commands:26 errors:0

> Logitech Bluetooth USB Dongle

There are Logitech dongles (ex. Logitech MX5000) that can work in two
modes Embedded and HCI. In embedded mode dongle emulates a USB device so
it seems to your PC that your using a normal USB mouse/keyoard.

If you hold the little red Button on the USB BT mini-receiver it will
enable the other mode. Hold the red button on the BT dongle and plug it
into the computer, and after 3-5 seconds of holding the button, the
Bluetooth icon will appear in the system tray. Discussion

> hcitool scan: Device not found

-   On some Dell laptops (e.g. Studio 15) you have to switch the
    Bluetooth mode from HID to HCI. Install the bluez-hid2hci package,
    then udev should do this automatically. Alternatively, you can run
    this command to switch to HCI manually:

    # /usr/lib/udev/hid2hci

-   If the device will not show up and you have a Windows operating
    system on your machine, try booting it and enable the bluetooth
    adapter from windows.

-   Sometimes also this simple command helps:

    # hciconfig hci0 up

> rfkill unblock: Do not unblock

If your device still soft blocked and you run connman.

Try this: $ connmanctl enable bluetooth

> My computer is not visible

Cannot discover computer from your phone? Enable PSCAN and ISCAN:

    # enable PSCAN and ISCAN
    $ hciconfig hci0 piscan 
    # check it worked

    $ hciconfig

    hci0:   Type: USB
            BD Address: 00:12:34:56:78:9A ACL MTU: 192:8 SCO MTU: 64:8
            UP RUNNING PSCAN ISCAN
            RX bytes:20425 acl:115 sco:0 events:526 errors:0
            TX bytes:5543 acl:84 sco:0 commands:340 errors:0

Note:Check DiscoverableTimeout and PairableTimeout in
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf

Try changing device class in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf as following:

    # Default device class. Only the major and minor device class bits are
    # considered.
    #Class = 0x000100 (from default config)
    Class = 0x100100

This was the only solution to make my computer visible for my phone.

> Logitech keyboard does not pair

If you do not get the passkey when you try to pair your Logitech
keyboard, type the following command:

    $ sudo hciconfig hci0 sspmode 0

If after pairing, the keyboard still does not connect, check the output
of hcidump -at. If the latter indicates repeatedly
connections-disconnections like the following message:

       status 0x00 handle 11 reason 0x13
       Reason: Remote User Terminated Connection

then, the only solution for now is to install the old Bluetooth stack.
