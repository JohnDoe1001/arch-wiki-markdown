Hardware
--------

The HP Mini 5102 has a newer 'pinetrail' 64 bit Atom. ( Intel(R)
Atom(TM) CPU N450 'pinetrail' x86_64 )

Arch Linux boot media does not have the correct network module ( amongst
others) so I ended up using a SMC usb to ethernet adapter to get an
install done.

> Kernel

I used http://code.google.com/p/kernel-netbook/ and will assume from
here on in that you are using this kernel too.

I have submitted a patch so this kernel works in 64bit mode.

This patch and other notes of interest is currently in the forums.

Edit: works with generic kernel as well.(2.6.34 x86_64)

> Video

> tested

Install xf86-video-intel(tested with this one) or
xf86-video-intel-newest.

Make sure to configure KMS correctly.

Let hal take care of everything and have no /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Works fine, Xorg is running.

> Webcam

> tested

UDev loads the correct driver. Works just fine with skype. Not sure of
brands etc here but lsmod shows it is detected

     [lunix@munix kernel-netbook]$ lsmod | grep video
     Module                  Size  Used by
     uvcvideo               51293  0
     videodev               30480  1 uvcvideo
     v4l1_compat            11024  2 uvcvideo,videodev

> Audio

> tested

Typical Intel HD Audio. Just follow ALSA. Works.

Make sure you have the latest version of alsa-utils, alsa-lib and
alsa-firmware.

> Touchpad

Works out of the box with GPM

     GPM_ARGS="-m  /dev/input/mice -t imps2"

> Wired Network

    $ lspci -vnn | grep Ethernet
    43:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Device [11ab:4381] (rev 11)

This is a 'SysKonnect Yukon2' and works fine after installing the
'kernel-netbook' kernel mentioned above

Wireless Driver

    $ lspci -vnn | grep Broadcom
     01:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation Device [14e4:4353] (rev 01)

This is a Broadcom 4353 and works fine with the Broadcom-wl drivers.

This works after upgrading to 'kernel-netbook' mentioned above in the
kernel section.

By default the wireless interface is named eth1 and not wlan0 as some
may be used to.

A quick hack with udev should fix this.

EDIT: Mine came with BCM4312, just follow: Broadcom BCM4312

> Built in WWAN or 3G modem

not tested

This is an optional extra and uses a Qualcomm mobile internet device

You will need to enable

     drivers - usb - serial - USB Qualcomm Serial modem

in the kernel and re-compile.

This will allow the device to show up in lsmod however it will still not
have a device special file in /dev yet as it needs to have the firmware
loaded. The following external page has some more info about this. Gobi
linux information

> Bluetooth

deteced but not tested

Below this line is directly copied from HP_Mini_5101 and is not tested
at all. I will update soon.

> ACPI

Suspend on Lid

This here works quite fine: Suspend to RAM#Automatic Suspend, the Hard
Way

It might be necessary to use "/etc/acpi/events/lm_lid" instead of
"/etc/acpi/events/lid". (laptop-mode?)

Just change the "LID" to it's actual value. For me it was C1D0.

    /etc/acpi/actions/lid_handler.sh

    if grep closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/C1D0/state >/dev/null ; then 

Power Button

Shutting system down by pressing the power button

Hotkeys

Display toggle

ACPI hotkeys

    # acpi_listen
    (Press fn+f2)
    video C088 00000080 00000000

So we have to edit

    /etc/acpi/handler.sh

like this

    /etc/acpi/handler.sh 

    case "$1" in
        .
        .
        .
        video)
            arandr #or path to your shell script for switching display mode
           Â ;;
        .
        .
        .
    esac

Mute, browser button, volume down, etc...
