especially Slovak ATD.

Arch Translation Day is a day dedicated to translating the ArchWiki to
other languages. The goal of this action is to connect arch-users and to
translate as much pages as possible to our native languages. This allows
those who do not speak English very well learn about Arch easier.

When?
-----

Arch Translation Day will take place on the first Saturday of every
month.

Who?
----

Everyone who wants to support our community somehow or wants to express
his thanks for ArchLinux is invited.

Why?
----

Are you asking why? Because we all use Arch and we like it. We use it on
our desktops and servers. We have it near at hand almost all the time.
This is the one way to offer our thanks that we can use it. We should
definitely allow access to all pieces of information for whom the
language is a barrier.

How?
----

See instructions here and visit translation team page of your language.

List of priority pages
----------------------

Here you can find the list of pages whose translation is the most
important. If you translate page, please remove it from the list.

    No pages

There are many articles that only exist in non-English languages. You
can find them on ArchWiki Translation Team.
