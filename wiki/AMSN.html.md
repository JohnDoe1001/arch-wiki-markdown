    -   2.1 No sound in aMSN
    -   2.2 Audio or audio+video conferencing isn't working

Installing
----------

Install amsn.

There are also packages in the AUR for extra plugins and skins. See here
for plugins and here for skins.

Troubleshooting
---------------

> No sound in aMSN

Install snack.

> Audio or audio+video conferencing isn't working

Audio calls and audio+video calls aren't working anymore due to a change
of protocol from Microsoft, as can be seen here [1].

This only concerns “Audio call” or “Audio+Video Call” which goes in both
directions as confirmed here [2]
