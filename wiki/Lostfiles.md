Lostfiles is a script for detecting orphaned files (files which are not
owned by any Arch Linux packages).

An AUR package has been created for easy and convenience: lostfiles

The script generates a list of all files owned by installed packages and
compares that against all files on the root filesystem showing the user
the difference, i.e. files on the filesystem that are not owned by a
package. Users can inspect the output and choose to leave any orphans
alone or to backup and delete them.

On 26-Oct-2013, User:Graysky assumed the duty of maintainer for the
script, hosting it in this public github repo; any user wishing to
modify the code is encouraged to submit a pull request.
