Firefox Plugin
--------------

> Install the official build

Note: This does not work with x86_64!

To install Gears in a default Arch installation you'll need to change a
setting in the browser.

By default the browser identifies itself as "Gran Paradiso/3.0.8", but
in order to download Gears the user-agent string must say Firefox.

To change this update the following value within about:config

    general.useragent.extra.firefox

Update the value from "Gran Paradiso/3.0.10" to "Firefox/3.0.10".

You should now be able to install Gears (from its homepage as
Firefox-AddOn), and hopefully avoid similar issues on other sites.

> Install from AUR

There's a PKGBUILD for the svn version in the AUR: google-gears-svn
