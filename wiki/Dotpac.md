dotpac helps you get rid of /{boot,etc}/*.pac* files

I wrote this simple script to speed up dealing with .pacnew and .pacsave
files in my /etc directory. I was tired of doing it manually almost
every day (find, diff, vi, mv, rm, again and again) and it was easy to
make a mistake.

Additionally, it may be even more helpful for newbies who do not know
where these files came from as it explains why pacman creates them.

All you need to do is to run dotpac (sorry, I didn't have time to think
up a better name) and go through a few dialogs. Don't worry, dotpac will
not do anything without your explicit command. Also please note that it
doesn't offer automagic merging *.pac* files with their working
equivalents.

Opinions, suggestions, ideas, bug reports are welcome.
