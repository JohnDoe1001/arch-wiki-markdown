Ubuntu Classroom

Arch Classroom is a project to develop and host teaching materials that
can be used by the wider Arch Linux community. These class materials can
then be used by anyone with the will and knowledge to teach a class. The
goal of Arch Classroom is to help increase the knowledge base of our
users, and give resources to teachers. Classes are made to be taught
either in person or online through a chat medium like IRC.

To get involved with Arch Classroom, try adding to the Arch wiki
documentation, creating a class lesson plan, or using the materials
hosted here to teach a class. If you are interested in taking a class on
a particular topic, make requests on the Arch Linux Forums, in the Arch
mailing list or in the Classroom discussion page.

> How to Create a Lesson Plan

Start your lesson plan with a goal or objective in mind. What should
students be expected to learn in this class? Decide what sort of
students you are targeting -- Beginning Linux users or People familiar
with particular software, etc. Make a materials list with all the
software requirements the class will need, and a list of prerequisites
with the knowledge students should have before taking the class. Create
lesson plans with topics of discussion, reading lists, and activities
that help to achieve the goal of the class. Classes may be in a reading
and lecture format, group discussion, or independent activities. Choose
a format that will best suit the information you are teaching. A
programming class could be taught with a series of follow by example
lectures plus some group problem solving. A class on the history of
Linux and free open source software could be reading and discussion
based.

> Upcoming Classes

Arch Linux Women is currently trying to organize a class on package
maintaining. For more information go to #archlinux-classroom @
irc.freenode.net

> Previous Classes

Classes that have already happened (maybe students and teachers could
write up some info on the experience, similar to the arch con pages)
