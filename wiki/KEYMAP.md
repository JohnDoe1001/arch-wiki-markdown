KEYMAP
======

The KEYMAP variable is specified in the /etc/vconsole.conf file. It
defines what keymap the keyboard is in the virtual consoles. Keytable
files are provided by the kbd package.

Keyboard layouts
----------------

This is the list of known keymap settings to work for the corresponding
keyboard layouts. Most keymaps can be found in the
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/layout (layout=qwerty, azerty, dvorak, etc.)
directory.

Less common but nonetheless useful keymaps for Arch Linux are found in
the /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/architecture (architecture=mac, sun, etc.)
directory.

You can find more info about your keyboard layout with:
less /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst

Note:In an X session, you can use setxkbmap to instantly apply keyboard
layout: setxkbmap -layout dvorak

Note:You can also use this method to modify single keys. This command
would assign the compose functionality to the caps lock key:
setxkbmap -option 'compose:caps' This allows for example to write
umlauts easily. Example for Umlaut A:  CAPSLOCK, ", A -> Ã„. You can also
configure the right Windows key as a Compose key with
setxkbmap -option 'compose:rwin'

Note:If these keymaps do not work for you, make sure the keymap file
exists in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ using find:
find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ -name "*[your desired keymap]*"

Note:You can see some instructions on how to use some keymaps in their
respective files with:  zless /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/.../.../xx.map.gz

Configuring the Console Keymap
------------------------------

1.  cd to /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty
2.  Copy your default keymap (us.map.gz) to a new file personal.map.gz
3.  gunzip the new map file
4.  Edit personal.map using your favorite editor. Examples:
    -   Make the Right Alt key same as Left Alt key (Emacs)  
        change the line include "linux-with-alt-and-altgr" to
        include "linux-with-two-alt-keys"
    -   Swap CapsLock with Escape (Vim)  
        make keycode 1 = Caps_Lock and keycode 58 = Escape
    -   Make CapsLock another Control key  
        change the line keycode 58 = Caps_Lock to keycode 58 = Control
    -   Swap CapsLock with Left Control key  
        make keycode 29 = Caps_Lock and keycode 58 = Control

5.  gzip the map file
6.  Change the default keyboard layout file that will be used by editing
    /etc/vconsole.conf (you might have to create this file) and changing
    the line that says KEYMAP=us to KEYMAP=personal
7.  Reboot to use your keymap the way nature intended (or run "loadkeys
    personal")
