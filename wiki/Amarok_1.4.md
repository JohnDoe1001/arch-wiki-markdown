-   Amarok 2

Amarok is a music player and organizer for Linux with an intuitive
interface. Version 1.4 is the most recent one released for KDE3
(although does run under KDE4 and Gnome as explained below). With KDE4
came Amarok 2.x. However, you might still be interested in running this
obsolete (until forked) version, because the developers have not yet
and/or do not want to port all the 1.4 features to 2.0, they see it as
an entirely different program.[1]

On the other hand, if you have never used Amarok 1.4 before, you may
find Amarok 2.x sufficient.

Installation
------------

> AUR

Build and install amarok1 from the AUR.

Configuration
-------------

> Integration with KDE4

Note: You can make the colors precisely match your KDE4 color scheme by
obtaining the three RGB values from the color selection dialogs in
System Settings > General > Appearance > Colors > Colors

In KDE4, you can set up the colors and fonts for KDE3 applications (such
as Amarok 1.4 and Kaffeine <1.0) without kcontrol by editing the file
~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals.

For example:

    [General]
    XftAntialias=true
    XftHintStyle=hintmedium
    alternateBackground=232,232,232
    background=224,223,223
    buttonBackground=232,231,231
    buttonForeground=20,19,18
    desktopFont=Tahoma,8,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0
    fixed=Courier New,8,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0
    font=Tahoma,8,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0
    foreground=20,19,18
    linkColor=66,109,161
    menuFont=Tahoma,8,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0
    selectBackground=65,141,212
    selectForeground=0,0,0
    smallestReadableFont=Tahoma,7,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0
    toolBarFont=Tahoma,8,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0
    visitedLinkColor=95,82,107
    widgetStyle=oxygen
    windowBackground=255,255,255
    windowForeground=20,19,18

    [Icons]
    Theme=oxygen

Oxygen icons to make Amarok version 1.4 fit better with KDE4 can be
found at kde-look.org.

Also set the colours and fonts in

Settings > Configure Amarok > Appearance

and

Settings > Configure Amarok > OSD.

> Integration with Gnome

See here for visual integration of the main GUI. There are also various
plugins that allow Amarok to use libnotify instead of its own OSD, for
example: LibnotifymaroK

> Scripts

Scripts can be found either directly from within Amarok
(Tools/Scripts/Get new scripts) or from kde-apps.org in the
Multimedia/Amarok Scripts section, or by using the kde-apps.org search
function and selecting Amarok Script as the type.

transKode

If you want to convert between audio formats from within Amarok, install
transKode from the AUR.

> Collection database

Amarok 1.4 can use sqlite (default), mysql or postgresql to store the
collection database. Users with large collections and more demanding
performance requirements might prefer one of the latter two options.

MySQL

For basic MySQL configuration refer to the MySQL page.

When using Amarok with MySQL you need to create a MySQL user that can
access the database. To do use, enter the following:

    # mysql -p -u root
    # CREATE DATABASE amarok;
    # USE amarok;
    # GRANT ALL ON amarok.* TO amarok@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'AMAROK_PASSWORD';
    # FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    # quit

This creates a database called 'amarok' and a user of the same name with
the password "AMAROK_PASSWORD" who can access said database from
localhost. If you want to connect to your database computer from a
different computer, change the line to

    # GRANT ALL ON amarok.* TO amarok@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'AMAROK_PASSWORD';

To configure amarok to use MySQL, enter the Configure Amarok screen,
choose Collection and change the database type to MySQL. Enter the host
name (usually "localhost" if on your local box, else the name of the
remote box), the username ("amarok" in this example) and your chosen
password. Don't forget to select the path to your music collection. Exit
with OK and update your database.

PostgreSQL

Amarok version 1.4 can utilise a PostgreSQL database for the music
collection. This feature is absent in version 2.x and unfortunately it
is not intended to reintroduce it.

See PostgreSQL. Install postgresql, and then set up a user and database
for amarok.

If there is no existing collection then simply set the hostname,
database, user and password in the Amarok settings, and then scan the
music files to build the database.

To migrate an existing sqlite database to postgresql:

-   backup your collection.db
-   switch to PostgreSQL and rebuild your collection
-   quit amarok
-   get your statistics back with the following commands:

    cd ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok && \
    sqlite3 collection.db .dump | grep 'INSERT INTO "statistics"' |\
    sed -e 's/,0)/,FALSE)/' -e 's/,1)/,TRUE)/' |\
    psql -U <amarok-user> <amarok-db>

Of course, replace <amarok-user> and <amarok-db> accordingly. We need
sed because otherwise psql complains we're trying to insert an integer
into a boolean field.

> Shoutcast

For reasons which have not been adequately explained, Amarok developers
have removed the Shoutcast internet radio features from version 2.1.90
onwards.

Amarok version 1.4 as well as VLC continue to support the Shoutcast
internet radio station index and streaming as before. The index is at

Playlists > Radio Streams > Shoutcast Streams
