Category:Virtualization
=======================

From Emulation or virtualization?:

Emulation is what we do when we try to make one system behave like or
imitate a different system. We want to take System A (something we
already have) and give it the inputs we would normally use for System B
(which we may not have) and have System A produce the same results as
System B.

Virtualization is a technique for using computing resources and devices
in a completely functional manner regardless of their physical layout or
location. This includes splitting a single physical computer into
multiple "virtual" servers, making it appear as though each virtual
machine is running on its own dedicated hardware and allowing each to be
rebooted independently.

This category contains pages about virtualization technologies such as
hypervisors, hypervisor control tools, cloud managment systems, etc. If
you are looking for articles about emulation, see Category:Emulators.
