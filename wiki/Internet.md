> Pastebin clients

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information: Pastebin

Pastebin services are often used to paste information into IRC channels
to help with troubleshooting. There are services for both text (e.g.
bpaste.net, pastie.org, codepad.org) and images (e.g. imgur.com,
picpaste.com). Pastebin clients allow you to post directy from the cli
without using a web browser.

Tip:The sprunge and ix pastebins can be accessed directly via curl,
which should return a link to the paste:

    <command> | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us<command> 2>&1 | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io

There is also a sprunge plugin for oh-my-zsh (a configuration tool for
the Zsh command shell).

Warning:Do not use pastebin.com. It appears to be the most popular site
but it is slow, full of adverts, formats the text badly (it will mess up
your code) and many people can not even open the site due to aggressive
spam filters.
