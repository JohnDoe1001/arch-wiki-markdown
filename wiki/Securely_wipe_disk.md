Common use cases
----------------

> Wipe all data left on the device

The most common usecase for completely and irrevocably wiping a device
will be when the device it going to be given away or also maybe sold.
There may be (unencrypted) data left on the device and you want to
protect against simple forensic investigation that is mere child's play
with for example File Recovery software.

If you want to quickly wipe everything from the disk /dev/zero or simple
patterns allow maximum performance while adequate randomness can be
advantageous in some cases that should be covered up in #Data remanence.

Every overwritten bit means to provide a level of data erasure not
allowing recovery with normal system functions (like standard ATA/SCSI
commands) and hardware interfaces. Any file recovery software mentioned
above then would need to be specialized on proprietary storage-hardware
features.

In case of a HDD data recreation will not be possible without at least
undocumented drive commands or fiddling about the deviceâ€™s controller or
firmware to make them read out for example reallocated sectors (bad
blocks that S.M.A.R.T. retired from use).

There are different wiping issues with different physical storage
technologys, most notably all Flash memory based devices and older
magnetic storage (old HDD's, floppy disks, tape).

> Preparations for block device encryption

If you want to prepare your drive to securely set up Disk
Encryption#Block device encryption inside the wiped area afterwards you
really should use #Random data generated by a trusted cryptographically
strong random number generator (referred to as RNG in this article from
now on).

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information: Random
number generation

Warning:If Block device encryption is mapped on a partition that
contains anything else than random/encrypted data, disclosure of usage
patterns on the encrypted drive is possible and weakens the encryption
being comparable with filesystem-level-encryption. Do never use
/dev/zero, simple patterns (badblocks, eg.) or other unrandom data
before setting up Block device encryption if you are serious about it!

Select a data source for overwriting
------------------------------------

As just said If you want to wipe sensitive data you can use anything
matching your needs.

If you want to setup block device encryption afterwards you should
always wipe at least with Pseudorandom data.

For data that is not truly random your disk's writing speed should be
the only limiting factor. If you need random data, the required system
performance to generate it may extremely depend on what you choose as
source of entropy.

Note:Everything regarding Benchmarking disk wipes should get merged
there.

> Unrandom data

Overwriting with /dev/zero or simple patterns is considered secure in
most resources. In the case of current HDD's it should be sufficient for
fast disk wipes.

Warning:A drive that is abnormally fast in writing patterns or zeroing
could be doing transparent compression. It is obviously presumable not
all blocks get wiped this way. Some #Flash memory devices do "feature"
that.

Pattern write test

#Badblocks can write simple patterns to every block of a device and then
read and check them searching for damaged areas (just like memtest86*
does with memory).

As the pattern is written to every accesible block this effectively
wipes the device.

> Random data

Note:Data that is hard to compress (random data) will get written
slower, if the drive logic mentioned in the #Unrandom data warning tries
compressing it. This should not lead to #Data remanence though. As
maximum write-speed is not the performance-bottleneck it can get
completely neglected while wiping disks with random data.

Kernel built-in RNG

The kernel build in RNG's /dev/(u)random are highly recommended for
producing reliable random data providing the same security level that is
used for the creation of cryptographic keys. The random number generator
gathers environmental noise from device drivers and other sources into
an entropy pool.

 /dev/random
    uses an entropy pool of 4096 bits (512 Bytes) to generate random
    data and stops when the pool is exhausted until it get's (slowly)
    refilled. /dev/random is absolutely not designed for wiping entire
    HDD's, but rather to generate cryptographic keys (e.g. SSL/SSH).
 /dev/urandom
    reuses existing entropy pool data while the pool is replenished and
    although not suited for the most crucial cryptographic purposes, for
    example the generation of longterm keys, its quality should be
    sufficient for a paranoid disk wipe, preparing for block device
    encryption, wiping LUKS keyslots, wiping single files and many other
    purposes.

For much better performance consider using a true pseudorandom number
generator.

Dd

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information:
Dd_(Unix)

Note:cp does the same as dd without any operands but is not designed for
more versatile disk wiping procedures.

Checking progress of dd while running

By default, there is no output of dd until the task has finished. With
kill and the "USR1"-Signal you can force status output without actually
killing the program. Open up a 2nd root terminal and issue the following
command:

    # killall -USR1 dd

Note:This will affect all other running dd-processes as well.

Or:

    # kill -USR1 <PID_OF_dd_COMMAND>

For example:

    # kill -USR1 $(pidof dd)

This causes the terminal in which dd is running to output the progress
at the time the command was run. For example:

    605+0 records in
    605+0 records out
    634388480 bytes (634 MB) copied, 8.17097 s, 77.6 MB/s

Dd spin-offs

Other dd alike programs feature periodical status output like i.e. a
simple progress bar.

dcfldd

dcfldd is an enhanced version of dd with features useful for forensics
and security. It accepts most of dd's parameters and includes status
output. The last stable version of dcfldd was released on December 19,
2006.[1]

ddrescue

GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It's capable of ignoring read
errors what is a useless feature for disk wiping in almost any case. GNU
ddrescue Manual

shred

Shred is a Unix command that can be used to securely delete files and
devices so that they can be recovered only with great difficulty with
specialised hardware, if at all.[2] Shred uses three passes, writing
pseudo-random data to the device during each pass. This can be reduced
or increased.

The following command invokes shred with its default settings and
displays the progress.

    # shred -v /dev/<drive>

Alternatively, shred can be instructed to do only one pass with entropy
from, e.g. /dev/urandom.

    # shred --verbose --random-source=/dev/urandom -n1 /dev/<drive>

> Badblocks

For letting badblocks perform a disk wipe a destructive read-write test
has to be done.

    # badblocks -c 10240 -wsv /dev/<drive>

Select a target
---------------

Note:Fdisk will not work on GPT formatted devices. Use gdisk instead.

Use fdisk to locate all read/write devices the user has read acess to.

Check the output for lines that start with devices such as /dev/sdX.

This is an example for a HDD formatted to boot a linux system:

    # fdisk -l

    Disk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes, 488397168 sectors
    Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disk identifier: 0x00ff784a

       Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System

Or the Arch Install Medium written to a 4GB USB thumb drive:

    # fdisk -l

    /dev/sdb1   *           0      802815      401408   17  Hidden HPFS/NTFS

> Block size

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information: Dd
(Unix)#Block size

If you have a Advanced Format hard drive it is recommended that you
specify a block size larger than the default 512 bytes. To speed up the
overwriting process choose a block size matching your drive's physical
geometry by appending the block size option to the dd command (i.e.
bs=4096 for 4KB).

Fdisk prints physical and logical sector size for every disk.

Alternatively sysfs does expose information:

    /sys/block/sdX/queue/physical_block_size
    /sys/block/sdX/queue/logical_block_size
    /sys/block/sdX/alignment_offset

Overwrite the disk
------------------

Warning:There is no confirmation regarding the sanity of this command so
repeatedly check that the correct drive or partition has been targeted.
Make certain that the of=... option points to the target drive and not
to a system disk.

Zero-fill the disk by writing a zero byte to every addressable location
on the disk using the /dev/zero stream.

    # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=4096

or the /dev/random stream:

    # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=4096

The process is finished when dd reports, No space left on device:

    dd: writing to â€˜/dev/sdbâ€™: No space left on device
    7959553+0 records in
    7959552+0 records out

  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information: Data
remanence

The residual representation of data may remain even after attempts have
been made to remove or erase the data.

Residual data may get wiped by writing (random) data to the disk with a
single or even more than one iteration. However, more than one iteration
may not significantly decrease the possibility to reconstruct the data
of hard disk drives. For more information see Secure deletion: a single
overwrite will do it - The H Security.

> Random data

If the data can get exactly located on the disk and was never copied
anywhere else, wiping with random data can be thoroughgoing and
impressively quick as long there is enough entropy in the pool.

A good example is cryptsetup using /dev/urandom for wiping the LUKS
keyslots.

> Hardware specific issues

Flash memory

Wikipedia:Write amplification and other characteristics make Flash
memory a stubborn target for reliable wiping. As there is a lot of
transparent abstraction in between data as seen by a device's controller
chip and the operating system sight data is never overwritten in place
and wiping particular blocks or files is not reliable.

Other "features" like transparent compression (all SandForce SSD's) can
compress your /dev/zero or pattern stream so if wiping is fast beyond
belief this might be the case.

Disassembling Flash memory devices, unsoldering the chips and analyzing
data content without the controller in between is feasible without
difficulty using simple hardware. Data recovery companys do it for cheap
money.

For more information see: Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid
State Drives.

Residual magnetism

Wiped hard disk drives and other magnetic storage can get disassembled
in a cleanroom and then analyzed with equipment like a magnetic force
microscope. This may allow the overwritten data to be reconstructed by
analyzing the measured residual magnetics.

This method of data recovery for current HDD's is largely theoretical
and would require substantial financial resources. Nevertheless
degaussing is still a practiced countermeasure.

Old magnetic storage

Securely wiping old magnetic storage (e.g. floppy disks, magnetic tape)
is much harder due to much lower memory storage density. Many iterations
with random data might be needed to wipe any sensitive data. To ensure
that data has been completely erased most resources advise physical
destruction.

Operating system, programs and filesystem

Note:This is not specific to any hardware obviously.

The operating system, executed programs or journaling file systems may
copy your unencrypted data throughout the block device. When writing to
plain disks this should only be relevant in conjunction with one of the
above.
