Xvidcap
=======

XVidCap is a free software used for recording a screencast or digital
recording of an X Window System screen output with an audio narration.
With it you can make a movie of anything running on under X.

Note:Xvidcap is no longer maintained and some parts do no work any
longer (like the ability to encode to video).

Quoted from the xvidcap sourceforge page:

"Xvidcap is a small tool to capture things going on on an X-Windows
display to either individual frames or an MPEG video. On Windows
machines there are commercial tools like Lotus ScreenCam or Camtasia
which do a very good job esp. for the purpose I was needing such a tool
for: Software documentation, esp. installation procedures and such.

On UNIX machines I have searched for a comparable tool for a long time
with little luck. Some day, I came across a program written by Rasca
Gmelch which went a good way, just not quite there. It was able to
capture to individual frames and save them in indivdual screenshots
(which can be converted into a video with tools like transcode.)

This approach for me required more storage than I had available, so I
added an on-line encoding facility using FFMPEG's
libavcodec/libavformat. And since Rasca no longer has the time to
maintain his code, I took over and the code to sourceforge.

Today, I suppose xvidcap does its basic job, though I find bugs and
possible improvements every day. If you are a developer, appreciate a
tool like xvidcap, and want to help improve it, contact me at the
sourceforge site."

Installation
------------

Install xvidcap from the Arch User Repository.

Usage
-----

Using the software is pretty self-explanatory. Be sure to select the
desired framerate prior to starting a capture. As well, setup the
quality level and video codec of your choice. Do not forget to save your
preferences.
