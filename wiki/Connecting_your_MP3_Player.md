Player types
------------

There are different kinds of portable audio players around:

> Players accessible with native protocols

-   iRiver
    -   All iRiver players with "Manager Mode" firmware should follow
        the instructions here: IRiver_iFP_Audio_Players

-   Creative
    -   Creative players, probably all that do not support USB storage,
        should be supported by gnomad2, available in the AUR.

-   Sony
    -   Sony Walkman MP3 players released prior to mid-2007 require
        Sony's proprietary "SonicStage" software to transfer files.
        Unfortunately, this software is only available for Windows.
        However, you are better off using the JSymphonic open source
        software anyway, as you will have more control over your player.
        JSymphonic is provided by the symphonic package, available in
        the AUR.

> Players accessible as USB storage

-   Creative
    -   Creative MuVo

Note:For some older MuVo models, deleting settings.dat from the device
renders it useless. Newer models do not have the file.

-   iRiver
    -   All iRiver players with "UMS Mode" firmware are recognized as
        USB storage

-   Cowon
    -   iAudio U2 MP3 player

-   NextCom
    -   flash drive + MP3 player

-   MPIO
    -   MPIO HD300

Accessing players
-----------------

You should mount your player, identified as USB storage, to access its
contents. See USB Storage Devices for details.
