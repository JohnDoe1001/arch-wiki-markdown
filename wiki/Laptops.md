Laptops and notebooks, because of their often unique hardware, have
always provided challenges to any distribution of Linux. However,
because laptops of the same model usually have identical hardware, a
great help is to learn from somebody else's experience with that same
model. Caveats are that some manufacturers use different hardware in the
same model in different regions of the world.

The purpose of this page is to:

-   Help laptop owners use Arch Linux on their laptops to both Arch's
    and their laptop's full potential
-   Guide prospective buyers of laptops, regarding support for Arch
    Linux
-   Identify issues with Arch Linux that when fixed will over time make
    Arch Linux the best Linux for laptops

If you have installed Arch Linux on a laptop, notebook (or other
device), please share your experience here with the Arch community, for
the benefit of all.
