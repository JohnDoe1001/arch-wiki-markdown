Kexec

Kexec is a system call that enables you to load and boot into another
kernel from the currently running kernel. This is useful for kernel
developers or other people who need to reboot very quickly without
waiting for the whole BIOS boot process to finish. Note that kexec may
not work correctly for you due to devices not fully re-initializing when
using this method, however this is rarely the case.

Installation
------------

To install kexec, install the kexec-tools package which is available in
the official repositories.

Rebooting using kexec
---------------------

> Systemd

You will need to create a new unit file, kexec-load@.service, that will
load the specified kernel to be kexec'ed[1].

    # vim /etc/systemd/system/kexec-load@.service

    [Unit]
    Description=loadÂ %i kernel into the current kernel
    Documentation=man:kexec(8)
    DefaultDependencies=no
    Before=shutdown.target umount.target final.target

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-%i --initrd=/boot/initramfs-%i.img --reuse-cmdline

    [Install]
    WantedBy=kexec.target

Then enable the service file for the kernel you want to load, for
example simply the default kernel linux:

    # systemctl enable kexec-load@linux

    ln -s '/etc/systemd/system/kexec-load@.service' '/etc/systemd/system/kexec.target.wants/kexec-load@linux.service'

Ensure that the shutdown hook is not part of your initramfs image by
removing it from the HOOKS array in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf. If it is,
remove it and rebuild your initrd image with mkinitcpio -p linux.

Then to kexec

    # systemctl kexec

If you wish to load a different kernel for the next kexec, for example
linux-lts, disable the service for the current kernel and enable the one
for the new kernel:

    # systemctl disable kexec-load@linux
    # systemctl enable kexec-load@linux-lts

Separate /boot partition

The above systemd unit file will fail if /boot is not on the root file
system, as systemd will likely unmount /boot before it runs the
kexec-load unit file. An alternative approach is to load a "hook" unit
file that does nothing on startup and invokes kexec upon termination. By
making this unit file conflict with kexec.target and only kexec.target,
you can ensure the new kernel gets loaded early enough and only after a
"systemctl kexec" command. Here is an alternate
/etc/systemd/system/kexec-load@.service file that follows this strategy:

    [Unit]
    Description=hook to load vmlinuz-%i kernel upon kexec
    Documentation=man:kexec(8)
    DefaultDependencies=no
    RequiresMountsFor=/boot/vmlinuz-%i
    Conflicts=kexec.target

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=-/usr/bin/true
    RemainAfterExit=yes
    ExecStop=/usr/bin/kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-%i --initrd=/boot/initramfs-%i.img --reuse-cmdline

    [Install]
    WantedBy=basic.target

Unfortunately, while the above file works reliably on some machines, the
ExecStop command seems to fail to run on others. Hence, at present there
does not appear to be a known reliable way to make "systemctl kexec" do
the right thing on all machines. Until then, it may be best to call
kexec manually before invoking "systemctl kexec" (or even "reboot",
which will do the right thing when a kernel is loaded).

> Manually

It is also perfectly legal to invoke kexec manually:

     # kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-linux --initrd=/boot/initramfs-linux.img --reuse-cmdline
     # kexec -e
