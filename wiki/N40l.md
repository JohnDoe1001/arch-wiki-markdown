N40l
====

Note:This page is currently under construction, I am planning on using
an arch install specified for a HP n40l microserver and will make this
page for anyone else who owns one of these awesome machines.

A few things about this product:

The current BIOS (29 July 2011) still does not support S3 sleep.

Driver xf86-video-ati seems to work just fine (xfce4) with the following
errors in /var/log/Xorg.0.log (I think these are my problems and not the
hardware):

[ 137.550] (EE) Failed to load module "vesa" (module does not exist, 0)

[ 137.550] (EE) Failed to load module "modesetting" (module does not
exist, 0)

[ 137.551] (EE) Failed to load module "fbdev" (module does not exist, 0)
