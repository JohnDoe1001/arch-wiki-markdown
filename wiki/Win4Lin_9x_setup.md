Win4Lin 9x setup
================

"Win4Lin was a proprietary software application for Linux which allowed
users to run a copy of Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000 or XP
applications on their Linux desktop." - Wikipedia:Win4Lin

Virtual Bridges discontinued support for Win4Lin 9x in 2007. The product
Win4Lin Pro Desktop, itself, ceased to be supported in March 2010. If
you are interested in such technology try QEMU/KVM or Wine which are
still in active development.
