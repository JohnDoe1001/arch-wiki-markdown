Introduction
------------

cw is a non-intrusive real-time ANSI color wrapper for common unix-based
commands on GNU/linux. cw is designed to simulate the environment of the
commands being executed, so that if a person types 'du', 'df', 'ping',
etc. in their shell it will automatically color the output in real-time
according to a definition file containing the color format desired. cw
has support for wildcard match coloring, tokenized coloring,
headers/footers, case scenario coloring, command line dependent
definition coloring, and includes over 50 pre-made definition files.

Installation
