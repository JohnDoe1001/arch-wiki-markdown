Master Boot Record
==================

> Summary

An overview of the Master Boot Record; the first sector of a partitioned
data storage device.

> Overview

In order to boot Arch Linux, a Linux-capable boot loader such as
GRUB(2), Syslinux, LILO or GRUB Legacy must be installed to the Master
Boot Record or the GUID Partition Table. The boot loader is responsible
for loading the kernel and initial ramdisk before initiating the boot
process.

Arch Boot Process

The Master Boot Record (MBR) is the first 512 bytes of a storage device.
The MBR is not a partition; it is reserved for the operating system's
bootloader and the storage device's partition table. An newer
alternative to MBR is the GUID Partition Table, which is part of the
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface specification.

Boot process
------------

Booting is a multi-stage process. Most PCs today initialize system
devices with firmware called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which
is typically stored in a dedicated ROM chip on the system board. After
system devices have been initialized, the BIOS looks for the bootloader
on the MBR of the first recognized storage device (hard disk drive,
solid state drive, CD/DVD drive, USB drive...) or the first partition of
the device. It then executes that program. The bootloader reads the
partition table, and is then capable of loading the operating system(s).
Common GNU/Linux bootloaders include GRUB and Syslinux.

History
-------

The MBR consists of a short piece of assembly code (the initial
bootloader â€“ 446 bytes), a partition table for the 4 primary partitions
(16 bytes each) and a sentinel (0xAA55).

The "Conventional" Windows/DOS MBR bootloader code will check the
partition table for one and only one active partition, read X sectors
from this partition and then transfer control to the operating system.
The Windows/DOS bootloader can not boot an Arch Linux partition because
it is not designed to load the Linux kernel, and it can only cater for
an active, primary partition (which GRUB safely ignores).

The GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) is the de facto standard bootloader
for GNU/Linux, and users are recommended to install it on the MBR to
allow booting from any partition, whether it be primary or logical.

Backup and restoration
----------------------

Because the MBR is located on the disk it can be backed up and later
recovered.

To backup the MBR:

    dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/mbr-backup bs=512 count=1

Restore the MBR:

    dd if=/path/mbr-backup of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

Warning:Restoring the MBR with a mismatching partition table will make
your data unreadable and nearly impossible to recover. If you simply
need to reinstall the bootloader see GRUB or Syslinux.

To erase the MBR (may be useful if you have to do a full reinstall of
another operating system) only the first 446 bits are zeroed because the
rest of the data contains the partition table:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1

Restoring a Windows boot record
-------------------------------

By convention (and for ease of installation), Windows is usually
installed on the first partition and installs its partition table and
reference to its bootloader to the first sector of that partition. If
you accidentally install a bootloader like GRUB to the Windows partition
or damage the boot record in some other way, you will need to use a
utility to repair it. Microsoft includes a boot sector fix utility
FIXBOOT and an MBR fix utility called FIXMBR on their recovery discs, or
sometimes on their install discs. Using this method, you can fix the
reference on the boot sector of the first partition to the bootloader
file and fix the reference on the MBR to the first partition,
respectively. After doing this you will have to reinstall GRUB to the
MBR as was originally intended (that is, the GRUB bootloader can be
assigned to chainload the Windows bootloader).

If you wish to revert back to using Windows, you can use the FIXBOOT
command which chains from the MBR to the boot sector of the first
partition to restore normal, automatic loading of the Windows operating
system.

Of note, there is a Linux utility called ms-sys (package ms-sys in AUR)
that can install MBR's. However, this utility is only currently capable
of writing new MBRs (all OS's and file systems supported) and boot
sectors (a.k.a. boot record; equivalent to using FIXBOOT) for FAT file
systems. Most LiveCDs do not have this utility by default, so it will
need to be installed first, or you can look at a rescue CD that does
have it, such as Parted Magic.

First, write the partition info (table) again by:

    ms-sys --partition /dev/sda1

Next, write a Windows 2000/XP/2003 MBR:

    ms-sys --mbr /dev/sda  # Read options for different versions

Then, write the new boot sector (boot record):

    ms-sys -(1-6)          # Read options to discover the correct FAT record type

ms-sys can also write Windows 98, ME, Vista, and 7 MBRs as well, see
ms-sys -h.
