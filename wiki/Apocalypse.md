Apocalypse
==========

Instructions on how to survive the apocalypse with Arch Linux.

In the unfortunate event of an apocalypse (should you happen to survive)
there may be one or two things in short supply, Naturally, things like
food, water and shelter will probably be top of the list. But what of
other essential items? Fortunately, at Arch Linux, we take the survival
of our distro, as well as Linux in general, very seriously. Plans are
currently being made to ensure that any post-apocalypse scenario will
not require Arch users to migrate to another system. Plans on how to
survive the apocalypse are also in development and will be included in
the core repository as soon as they are available.
