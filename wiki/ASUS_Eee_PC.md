ASUS Eee PC
===========

This should be the page to gather all information on installing and
running arch on the Asus Eee. Why? Because the 'old' page is a bit
confusing/outdated, wrongly named (makes finding it in a search hard)
and the title limits it to just the install precedure.

The 'old' page should be cleaned up and merged into this page, and any
future information should also go on this page. If no one that actualy
owns an Eee want to do it, then I (Mr.Elendig) can do it, but it will
take some time.

Until this page actualy get some contents, go to Installing Arch Linux
on the Asus EEE PC.

Eee 700 Series and 900
======================

This should be filled with the majority of the content from Installing
Arch Linux on the Asus EEE PC.

> Installation

Installation can be achieved from an external cdrom drive, or from a usb
stick configured as described in Install from USB stick

The wireless module (ath5k) is now part of the stock kernel. The stock
kernel performs very well on the eeepc. You do not need to install any
extra packages from AUR for wireless or install any special kernel.

During installation make sure you add the following packages in addition
to the base packages for wireless to work.

    wireless_tools
    netcfg

Thats all you now need for a working eee.

> If you do want an optimized Pentium-M kernel

toofishes created a repository for the Eee. You can find some basic
packages like a Pentium-M optimized kernel. Add

    [eee]
    Server = http://code.toofishes.net/packages/eee

to your /etc/pacman.conf to use the repository.

Simply use pacman to install the package you need. Install the packages
with this command:

    # pacman -S kernel-eee

Then, add the following to /boot/grub/menu.lst; note that no initrd is
needed:

    # (2) Arch Linux
    title  Arch Linux EEE kernel
    root   (hd0,0)
    kernel /boot/vmlinuzeee root=/dev/sda1 ro

Restart and select Arch Linux EEE kernel from the grub boot menu.

> Xorg

Xorg works without an xorg.conf on the eeepc fine with the new
hotplugging system. See Xorg.

> Sound

If sound does not work in a new installation add the following line to
/etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf

    options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-dig

Eee 900A
========

The 900A is a 900 with a Intel Atom CPU and new hardware (the most is
like in 901), you can get help in Asus Eee PC 900A.

Eee 901, 904, and 1000(H)
=========================

The 901, 904, and 1000(H) all seem to share much-of, if not all the same
hardware. The steps for setting up Arch Linux are as follows. NB. There
is a separate wiki page as well dedicated to the 901.

Setting up the Network
----------------------

Two PKGBUILD files are available in the AUR to help you get your network
interfaces up and running. The first is delcake's "atl1e" drivers for
your wired ethernet, and the second is jbooth's "eeert2860" drivers for
wireless.

> atl1e

delcake's PKGBUILD is located here in the AUR. Note that in order to
build this package, you will need to get the unrar and unzip packages
from the mirror of you choice, as well as the LinuxDrivers.zip source
code linked on the AUR page unless you did your wireless drivers first.

1.  Transfer the PKGBUILD to your Eee PC. Get the source files too if
    you do not have internet yet.
2.  Install the unrar and unzip packages if you do not already have
    them.
3.  Issue a 'makepkg' command at the location of the PKGBUILD.

If all goes well, a .pkg.tar.gz file that starts with the name atl1e
will have been created in the same folder.

As root, run 'pacman -U <package name>.pkg.tar.gz' to install your newly
created module. In order to detect it, run both 'depmod -a' and
'modprobe atl1e' as root in that order.

At this point, you should be able to issue an ip a command and see your
brand new eth0 device staring back at you. Don't forget to add atl1e to
your modules list in /etc/rc.conf to automatically load your ethernet
module during boot.

-   WARNING: You will need to recompile this module any time you do a
    kernel upgrade, so hang on to that PKGBUILD and zip file.

> eeert2860

jbooth's PKGBUILD is located here in the AUR. Note that in order to
build this package, you will need to get the wireless_tools package from
the mirror of your choice, as well as Ralink's drivers listed under the
sources section unless you did your wired drivers first.

1.  Transfer the PKGBUILD to your Eee PC. Get the source files too if
    you do not have internet yet.
2.  Install the wireless_tools package if you do not already have it.
3.  Issue a 'makepkg' command at the location of the PKGBUILD.

Hopefully, the makepkg command went through without a hitch, and a
.pkg.tar.gz file will have been created in the same folder.

As root, run 'pacman -U <package name>.pkg.tar.gz' to install your newly
created module. In order to detect it, run both 'depmod -a' and
'modprobe rt2860sta' as root in that order.

Now you should see your ra0 wireless device in the output of ip a. As
root, run ip link set dev ra0 up to bring up the interface for
configuration.

-   Still no ra0 device? Make sure that the WLAN device is enabled in
    your BIOS.

-   WARNING: You will need to recompile this module any time you do a
    kernel upgrade, so hang on to the PKGBUILD and .tar.bz2 file.

After running alsaconf the graphics card was the default audio output,
so I had to create /etc/asound.conf with the following contents:

    defaults.ctl.card 1
    defaults.pcm.card 1
    defaults.timer.card 1

Powersaving
-----------

When system is idle, ATI/AMD's propretary driver(catalyst) saves 2.5W
than xf86-video-ati.

Eee 1015 BX
===========

Most seems to work 'out-of-the-box':

-   Wlan
-   Ethernet
-   Graphics (using the xf86-video-ati driver)
-   Webcam
-   Suspend-to-RAM (with acpi & acpid)
-   Cardreader
-   CPU Frequency Scaling (add 'eeepc-wmi ac battery button fan video'
    to MODULES array in '/etc/rc.conf')
-   TouchPad (using the xf86-input-synaptics driver)

  
 My blacklist:

    # /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
    blacklist sp5100_tco

For sound at DE add this file to your HOME-directory:

    #
    # ~/.asoundrc
    #

    defaults.ctl.card 1
    defaults.pcm.card 1
    defaults.timer.card 1

For volume-control-buttons I use shortcuts with:

    amixer -q -c 1 set Master 5+
    amixer -q -c 1 set Master 5-
    amixer -q -c 1 set Master toggle

  

Eee 1015 PE/PEM

Installation
------------

To install Arch on the Asus Eee 1015 series you need to use an external
cd-rom drive or USB Installation Media.

The partition created by Asus on my 1015 PEM is as follows:

    Number Start    End    Size   Type      File System   Flags
    1      1049kb   107Gb  107Gb  primary   NTFS           
    2      107Gb    123Gb  16.1Gb primary   fat32         hidden
    3      123Gb    250Gb  127Gb  primary   NTFS          
    4      250Gb    250Gb  21.2Gb primary   

Results may vary. The first partition was the Windows 7 installation.
The second is the recovery partition with splashtop. Removing this
second partition will cause the fast-start Linux to stop working. The
third is Windows D:\ drive and the last one is the boot partition for
Windows 7.

Due to the limitations of having 4 partitions per drive I installed arch
on the first 107Gb partition and created a swap file instead of a
partition as per Swap.

> ACPI

ACPI works fine following the acpid guide. The following is for older
versions of the kernel.

To enable acpi you need to edit menu.lst and add acpi_osi=Linux to the
kernel line like so:

     kernel /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda1 ro acpi_osi=Linux

This enabled you to trigger devices in /sys/devices/platform/eeepc/.

Note:As far as I can tell, this is no longer required. If you do add it,
the module eeepc-wmi will fail to load - kernel 2.6.39.2-1

> Modules

In order to get CPU frequency scaling as well as the proper
special-purpose Eee PC module loaded, you can use the following MODULES
statement in /etc/rc.conf:

     MODULES=( acpi-cpufreq cpufreq_ondemand eeepc-wmi )

If you get double keypresses for with your function keys (like the mute
key, etc.), add the following into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
(Create this file if it isn't present)

    blacklist eeepc-laptop

Note:As long as you do not add acpi_osi-Linux to menu.lst, the eeepc
modules load automagically and are not required in MODULES

Note:As of kernel 3.3.7-1, no extra modules are required in order for
full usage of Arch Linux on this laptop.

Things that work out of the box: Wifi, Ethernet, Video (max resolution
available with basic Xorg and xfce packages installed), Touchpad,
Keyboard (Fn keys not working).

Things that need work: Audio, Fn keys, Power management.

Installation
------------

Arch setup encountered no problems, GRUB installed successfully with no
damages to Windows (need to uncomment the windows lines in in
/boot/grub/menu.lst) and Express Gate.

Audio
-----

With the xfce4 desktop environment audio doesn't work by default (didn't
test with other de). To fix this, add the following lines in your
~/.asoundrc:

    defaults.pcm.card 1
    defaults.ctl.card 1

(Credit to Touko Korpela from the Debian mailing list)

Video
-----

Youtube videos with the default ati driver work flawlessly with a
resolution of 720p, while with 1080p playback isn't smooth anymore.
Didn't test with the catalyst drivers, maybe a better playback could be
achieved.

Power Management
----------------

ACPI executes correctly and returns remaining battery life. Cpufreq
doesn't seem to work, hence making it impossible for Jupiter ([1]) to
manage the Super Hybrid Engine. However, from the Jupiter tray icon,
screen orientation, resolution and touchpad can be toggled and modified.

By suggestion from the Debian mailing list, I tried loading
"powernow-k8" with modprobe to get cpufreq working. This is apparently a
bug in the driver detection mechanism of cpufreq, and should be reported
upstream, I guess. After loading that module, cpufreq-info seems to
work. Have not tried getting Jupiter to manage SHE yet after that.

Suspend and hibernate work OK, with one tiny bug: I can't seem to get
the SD-card reader working after resuming from hibernate. After a
reboot, it works fine.
