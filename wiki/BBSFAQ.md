> How to use BBS

Forum Etiquette

Before you post a problem on the forum, you should do the following:

-   Read the documentation and the Arch wiki (this will solve most "How
    do I do x?" problems)
-   Use an internet search engine to try to find pages that already
    contain the solution
-   Use the Arch Linux forum search for the same thing

If you really can't find the answer after that, use the following
guidelines for posting:

-   Choose a descriptive title (not "MY SYSTEM IS BROKEN, HELP!!!!!",
    which is not only unhelpful but also rude and childish)
-   Provide specific information, such as setup, applications involved,
    error messages, relevant logs, etc ("it doesn't work" and "x is
    broken" are not helpful)
-   Be polite. Nobody owes you any help.

Once you've found the answer, edit your first post and add "[SOLVED]" to
title. If you find the solution yourself, do not forget to post it as
well.

> Automount

1.  USB automount doesn't work with normal user

> Pacman

1.  pacman error: FILENAME exists in filesystem
2.  pacman versus abs

> 32/64 bit

1.  Arch only seeing 3GB of memory out of 4GB!

> Upgrade

1.  klibc: /usr/lib/klibc/include/asm/Kbuild exists in filesystem

Many things break after upgrade

1.  Think before you upgrade
