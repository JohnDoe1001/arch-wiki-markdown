Category:Networking
===================

Arch Linux provides netctl for network management. netctl supports wired
connections on desktops and servers, as well as wireless setups and
roaming for mobile users, facilitating easy management of network
profiles. NetworkManager and Wicd are popular third-party alternatives.

Programs that conjoin networks, perform authentication, or perform
specialized (non end-user) services are usually found in this category.

P2P (Peer-to-Peer) networking, BitTorrent clients, chat clients, and
other internet-aware applications are found in category Internet
applications. Programs that serve web pages, email servers, and code
repository servers are found in category Web Server. Content Management
Systems are listed under Web Server, but they have a large database
component as well. Database servers are not categorized as web servers
for our purposes; see Database management systems.
