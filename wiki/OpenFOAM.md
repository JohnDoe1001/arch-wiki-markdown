Overview
--------

The OpenFOAMÂ® (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox is a
free, open source CFD software package produced by OpenCFD Ltd. It has a
large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both
commercial and academic organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range
of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving
chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and
electromagnetics. It includes tools for meshing, notably snappyHexMesh,
a parallelised mesher for complex CAD geometries, and for pre- and
post-processing. Almost everything (including meshing, and pre- and
post-processing) runs in parallel as standard, enabling users to take
full advantage of computer hardware at their disposal.
