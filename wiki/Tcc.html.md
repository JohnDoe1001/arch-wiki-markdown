Tcc
===

Tcc is a small and fast C compiler.

Installation
------------

Install tcc form the Official repositories.

Usage
-----

Tcc is similar to gcc, but it can also run C programs without compiling.
For example,

     tcc -run foo.c

You can make a C source file executed by gcc by adding a shebang

     #!/usr/bin/tcc -run
