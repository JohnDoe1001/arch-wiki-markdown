Installing Adobe AIR
--------------------

Install adobe-air-sdk from the AUR.

Installing an AIR Application
-----------------------------

Download the application, and unzip it to /opt/airapps/<appname>. To run
it you can use the command

    $ /opt/adobe-air-sdk/bin/adl -nodebug /opt/airapps/<Application name>/META-INF/AIR/application.xml /opt/airapps/<Application name>/

> Making it executable

You can also make an executable by creating a file in /usr/bin:

     #! /bin/sh
     /opt/adobe-air-sdk/bin/adl -nodebug /opt/airapps/<Application name>/META-INF/AIR/application.xml /opt/airapps/wimp/

The app might need parameters (voddler) so then the script can look
like:

     #! /bin/sh
     /opt/adobe-air-sdk/bin/adl -nodebug /opt/airapps/<Application name>/META-INF/AIR/application.xml /opt/airapps/wimp/ -- $1 $2 $3 $4

Then chmod the file so that it can execute:

    $ chmod +x filename

Now you have installed an application in AIR. Yes it is this sillyÂ :P

> Removing the application

Delete the application folder in /opt/airapps. Also delete the
executable if you created one.
