Category:Package management
===========================

Packages in Arch Linux are built using makepkg and a custom build script
for each package (known as a PKGBUILD). Once packaged, software can be
installed and managed with pacman. PKGBUILDs for software in the
official repositories are available from the ABS tree; thousands more
are available from the (unsupported) Arch User Repository.

Here you will find articles on how to find, install, remove and
otherwise manage your software packages using pacman and the Arch Build
System.
