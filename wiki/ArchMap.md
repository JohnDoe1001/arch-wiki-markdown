History
-------

ArchMap was originally created by xterminus. He created jpeg files that
could be downloaded from this page. However, he didn't have the time to
maintain them anymore, so he dropped the project.

When Google Earth for Linux was released, brain0 recreated the project.

The third version of ArchMap is based on Google Maps. This project is
still active.

Google Maps
-----------

You can find it here: ArchMap  
 ArchMap should always be up-to-date. Scripts on server regenerate KML
file daily. Obviously you can download this file and load it in Google
Earth.

If you have any suggestions please post them here.

Google Earth Map
----------------

ArchMap is now available as Google Earth .kmz file maintained by brain0.
You can download it here (last updated 02.09.2009, but it doesn't work -
I hadn't updated this since 2009, if anyone can figure out what's wrong,
tell me FIX: The Problem was the "&" in the entry from
Bosnia&Herzegovina. I fixed the entry to "Bosnia and Herzegovina" on the
wiki, now you just need to regenerate the kml from that).

You can add the coordinates to Google Earth permanently:

-   Right click on "My Places"
-   Go to Add -> Network Link
-   Enter ArchMap into the Name field and put the above link into the
    URL field. Then press OK.

You can refresh the data by right-clicking the ArchMap folder and
selecting "Refresh".

> Screenshots

These are some screenshots to demonstrate how it looks:

-   Europe
-   US
-   South America

Of course, to view everything you will still need Google Earth.

List yourself
-------------

Go to the ArchMap List page and use the Edit button to add yourself to
the World Map. Use decimal coordinates; positive numbers mean north and
east, negative numbers mean south and west, resp. The comment is
optional.

The maps are regenerated whenever there has been some activity on the
list.

> Finding your coordinates

Find your coordinates at

-   You can determine them easily inside Google Earth or Google Maps
    (see ArchMap List page)
-   multimap.com (numbers are in brackets under the map)
