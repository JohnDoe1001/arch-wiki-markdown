  Summary help replacing me
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  This article explains how to install and configure Clojure.

Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a
general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive
development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust
infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled
language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely
dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime.
Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type
hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid
reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
