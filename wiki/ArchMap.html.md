History
-------

ArchMap was originally created by xterminus. He created jpeg files that
could be downloaded from this page. However, he didn't have the time to
maintain them anymore, so he dropped the project.

When Google Earth for Linux was released, brain0 recreated the project.

The third version of ArchMap was based on Google Maps.

ArchMap is now developed in the open on GitHub, this iteration was
started by alux.

Maps
----

All of the code to generate your own .geojson file is up on GitHub. The
repo also contains pre-generated .geojson and .kml files, these files
are used to make the maps below.

If you have any suggestions please post them here or create an issue in
the repo.

> OpenStreetMap

One rendering of the map is hosted by MapBox, this to be updated
manually by alux importing the .geojson file.

> Google Maps

To display the coordinates in Google Maps, enter this link to the .kml
file into the search bar. Here is that search.

> Google Earth

You can add the coordinates to Google Earth permanently:

-   Right click on "My Places"
-   Go to Add -> Network Link
-   Enter ArchMap into the Name field and put
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maelstrom59/ArchMap/master/markers.kml
    into the Link field. Then press OK.

You can refresh the data by right-clicking the ArchMap folder and
selecting "Refresh".

List yourself
-------------

the World Map. Use decimal coordinates; positive numbers mean north and
