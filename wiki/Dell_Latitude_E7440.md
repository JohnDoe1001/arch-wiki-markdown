Hardware Overview
-----------------

I have a December 2013 model, configured with Intel Core i5-4300U,
integrated Intel HD4400 graphics adapter, Intel Ethernet and wireless
network adapter and a 1080p screen. Your configuration may differ from
mine.

Installation
------------

You can follow the Installation guide to get yourself up and running. I
simply transfered a 7mm SSD drive on my previous laptop to this one and
the Arch Linux on it boots without errors.

What drivers to get
-------------------

-   Intel Graphics for HD4400 graphics card. ===> MAJOR PERFORMANCE
    IMPACT:

After a very long research and several tens of reboots I came up with
the conclusion that if you power on the laptop without having AC
connected the overall GPU performance will be WAY worse than if you did
with the AC connected. It does not matter whatsoever if you connect AC
afterwards - GPU/OpenGL/drawing _IS_ going to be slow once you've
started it without AC.

As a benchmark I've used the redraw time of pidgin GTK windows and the
mouse moving speed of maps.google.com. Google maps should be very
responsive and not laggy at all.

Tested on: i3-git, mesa-full-i965 and xf86-video-intel-git 2.99.911-1
but this was reproducing on the stable versions of mesa and i915 driver.

Laptop bios version A05. Meanwhile I've upgraded to bios version A08 and
this issue seems to have been fixed.

  

-   Wireless#iwlwifi for Intel 7260 wifi card.
-   Synaptics for Touchpad

What does not work
------------------

-   The O2 Micro SD-card reader does not work as of 2014-01-18, Linux
    3.12.7-1-ARCH. Output from dmesg:

    [    2.441999] sdhci: Secure Digital Host Controller Interface driver
    [    2.442001] sdhci: Copyright(c) Pierre Ossman
    [    2.442172] sdhci-pci 0000:03:00.0: SDHCI controller found [1217:8520] (rev 1)
    [    2.442262] mmc0: Unknown controller version (3). You may experience problems.
    [    2.442967] mmc0: Hardware doesn't specify timeout clock frequency.

-   It seems that bluetooth on Intel 7260 is not working out of the box,
    but I don't know how to test it further. Tested and seems to be
    working. Bluetooth is usable with "gnome-control-center bluetooth".

-   Webcam does not work with Virtualbox (as of community/virtualbox
    4.3.6-1), but it works with native programs such as skype.

What are not tested
-------------------

-   I don't have fingerprint reader or smartcard reader installed in my
    configuration, so they are not tested.

Troubleshooting
---------------

> "Invalid partition table!" when booting

If you use BIOS+MBR boot method and msdos partition table, the BIOS may
show this error message before entering Syslinux or other boot loaders.
To prevent it, put the "boot" label on a primary partition (instead of a
logical partition). You may refer to the wiki page of your boot loader
to see how this works. It may be a "kindly reminder" to Windows users,
since Windows can only boot on primary partitions.
