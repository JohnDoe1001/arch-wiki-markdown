In biology, mutualism is an interaction between two organisms from which
each derives benefit. This principle also applies to proactive members
of the Arch community wanting to get involved and contribute to their
favorite Linux distribution. This participation benefits not only the
community member and their fellow Archers, but all users of free and
open source software.

Official Arch Linux projects
----------------------------

> Post on the forums

One of the easiest ways to get involved is participating in the Arch
Linux Forums, which allow getting to know the community and help new
users.

Please get accustomed with Forum Etiquette. Forum staff can be contacted
via forum@archlinux.org.

> Improve this wiki

ArchWiki is a collaboratively maintained Arch Linux documentation. All
users are encouraged to contribute.

> Join the chatroom

You can help other users to solve problems on the IRC Channel. It is of
vital importance however, that you read both the rules and guidelines
before participating. Further channels are available for specific
topics.

> Report installed packages

pkgstats provides a cron job that sends a list of the packages installed
on your system, along with the architecture and the mirrors you use, to
the Arch Linux developers in order to help them prioritize their efforts
and make the distribution even better. The information is sent
anonymously and cannot be used to identify you. You can view the
collected data at the Statistics page. More information is available in
this forum thread.

> Fix and report bugs

Reporting and fixing bugs on the bug tracker is one of the possible ways
to help the community.

However, ineffective use can be counter-productive. Please read the bug
reporting guidelines.

> Create and adopt AUR packages

The Arch User Repository contains community-made package scripts so that
users can easily install software that is not in the official
repositories. Popular packages get included into the official
[community] repository.

You can help by creating and adopting packages.

> Official software projects

You can get involved in the development of official Arch Linux software
projects.

> Participate in events

There are yearly and monthly events for bugfixing, translating and
cleanup. You can find forthcoming events in the Arch Linux Event
Calendar.

> Donate money

You can find out how to help sustaining server costs on the official
Arch Linux donate page.

FAQ
---

Q: How can I become an Arch Developer?

A: The main motivation for your work on Arch should be helping the whole
community, and not simply trying to become an Arch developer by any
means.  

Usually, new developers are picked by the existing developers as the
workload increases. Sometimes they post a position and you can apply to
fill it, but more often, they just invite somebody they know would be
good at it and would fit in well with the rest of the team. Having a
portfolio of Arch contributions is the best way to make it on the team.

Here is a list of things that you may do in order to gain some
"popularity" towards Arch's developers:

-   Establish a reputation as being helpful by offering assistance
    whenever possible.
-   Answer questions on the forum, IRC, and mailing lists.
-   Join the Trusted Users to gain packaging experience to show your
    skills.
-   Submit packages to the AUR.
-   Join one of the offshoot projects that may be incorporated into Arch
    mainstream someday, or start your own.
-   Work on pacman, makepkg, initscripts, or other source code and
    submit patches to the bug tracker.
-   Traverse the bug tracker and fix existing bugs.
-   Find and submit new bugs.
-   Fix wiki errors, add new pages, clean up existing pages, and make
    sure the procedures are up-to-date.
-   Submit translations.

Q: How can I become a Trusted User?

A: Please read Trusted Users#How to become TU?.

Q: What can I do as an artist?

A: Feel free to share wallpapers, splash screens, color palettes,
widgets, themes, etc. with the community on the art subforum.
