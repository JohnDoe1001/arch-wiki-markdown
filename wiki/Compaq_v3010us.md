Like many laptops, these model is cursed with the "Broadcom Corporation
Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-PCI Card" wireless card.

Good news, you can exchange it with another Mini-PCI card or we can try
and get it to work as best as possible.

Install
-------

I have worked with both Arch Stable (0.7.2) and Current (0.8.0 beta) in
both i686 and x86_64 architectures.

i686 +software +hw -wifi x86_64 +wifi -software -hw

No real difference between Stable and Current for this laptop, so you
may install as you would any other box or book.
