This settings are meant for HD audio playback at 24bit depth and 96000Hz
frequency. So there's no need to change anything default if your audio
sources have standard CD quality.

Alsa
----

    ~/.asoundrc

    defaults.pcm.!rate_converter "samplerate_best"	
    defaults.pcm.dmix.!rate 96000	
    defaults.pcm.dmix.!format S24_LE

An exclamation sign causes a previous definition to be overridden. This
syntax can be used with any configuration file assignment.

Dmix is enabled as default for soundcards which do not support hardware
mixing.

Pulseaudio
----------

Since Pulseaudio server is not intended to deliver high quality streams
for the sake of usability, it is recommended to just not install it.

    /etc/pulse/daemon.conf 

    resample-method = src-sinc-medium-quality
    default-sample-format = s24le
    default-sample-rate = 96000

SRC resampling algorithm is very cpu intensive. Setting it to medium
quality should work better.
