Create a new page and its translation
-------------------------------------

1.  If you do not know how to edit wiki pages, read Help:Editing.
2.  Read Help:i18n. It contains a comprehensive guideline for ArchWiki
    internationalization and localization.
3.  Login, to edit wiki.
4.  Choose a page to translate. You can use the random page function or
    translate some page/s in the list of priority pages. Just for
    example we choose Some Page.
5.  Go on the selected page and in the horizontal menu click on the edit
    item.
6.  Add an interlanguage link for the translation you are going to
    create (see Help:i18n#Interlanguage links)
7.  Copy all page source code.
8.  Save the page (with the new interlanguage link)
9.  Afterwards visit the interlanguage link you have just created, which
    will lead you to Some Page (''Language''), where Language is the
    language name associated to the translation you are going to create.
10. Since the page does not exists, establish a new page by clicking on
    create in the horizontal menu.
11. You will be shown a simple WYSIWYG editor: here you paste your
    copied page source.
12. Change the Category to your localized version. For example, change
    [[Category:Internationalization]] to
    [[Category:Internationalization (简体中文)]]
13. Change the interlanguage link that you created earlier so that now
    it points to the article you copied the source from.
14. Translate the copied page text and save everything properly.
15. Update the interlanguage links of all the other translations of the
    article by adding the link to the page you have just created.
16. Create a second ArchWiki page with a localized name. Visit
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Localized name of translated page.
17. Establish a new page again and put this code into it:

        #REDIRECT [[Some_Page_(Language)]]
