Goals
-----

The primary objective of ArchWiki is to provide the Arch Linux user
community with the most comprehensive and the most accessible
documentation on the web. This is a world-wide project with many
participants from all corners of the globe. The wiki embraces The Arch
Way with respect to simplicity. ArchWiki is constantly evolving and
thrives on collaboration; there is always room for improvement.

> Comprehensive

One of the primary objectives of ArchWiki is to cover all aspects of
computing using Arch Linux. From the media center to managing corporate
networks, anything Arch Linux can achieve is within the scope of
ArchWiki.

> Accessible

The primary goal of ArchWiki may be grandiose, and thousands of articles
are required; ArchWiki must offer a simple and intuitive way of
accessing all the information. This is not a simple task, but typical
Arch ingenuity and imagination will prevail.

The official arch-wiki-docs package offers users the ability to download
a copy of ArchWiki content. See this forum discussion for details.

How it works
------------

ArchWiki is maintained by several Administrators, Maintainers and
thousands of contributors. Users edit and organize articles to offer
readers the best in Arch Linux documentation. The contents are created
by the community, for the community: most articles are not written by a
single person, but represent a cumulative effort of many people that
correct erroneous information, update outdated articles, and otherwise
keep improving the ArchWiki contents.

How you can help
----------------

ArchWiki is maintained by volunteers. Maintainers are never too
numerous, and help is always needed. If you feel capable of editing wiki
pages, consider donating some of your time and energy to the community.

Please see ArchWiki:Tasks to discover ways to contribute.
