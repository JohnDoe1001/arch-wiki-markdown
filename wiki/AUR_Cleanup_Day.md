AUR Cleanup Day
===============

About
-----

AUR Cleanup Day is a semi-yearly event at the 20th of September.

Cleanup suggestions will be looked at sooner if you submit them to the
aur-general mailing list. Some guidelines are listed here.

The AUR has a large number of obsolete packages which could use cleaning
up. Examples of packages that may be cleaned up are:

-   Packages that have been renamed or replaced
-   Old and unmaintained developmental (cvs/svn/etc) packages

Post suggestions of packages on the AUR Cleanup Day pages below. Trusted
Users will get together and go though the list in a couple of weeks
after the event and confirm which packages should be removed.
