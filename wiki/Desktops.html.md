This is the place where you can describe your experience with desktops.
It is not a hot topic like laptops, but entering your data can help
others. Whatever is working or not working you can put here. Select
vendor and add to the list on the next page.

For your convenience, the first row of table data has been entered for
you to copy and than enter your own data.

Don't be shy to enter comments and tips for old hardware, as many new
users installed first Linux on some old box, just to see how it looks.
