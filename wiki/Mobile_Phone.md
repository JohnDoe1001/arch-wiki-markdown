iPhone
------

You will need libimobiledevice-git and libgpod-git compiled with afc
support. You can use the ifuse-git to mount your iPod or if you use
GNOME you can compile Gvfs with the option --with-afc [1].

For more info see the iPod page.

CDMA
----

CDMA includes phones on Samsung, LG, Sanyo, and more.

Right now there is no easy way to use CDMA phones. The best option is
Bitpim.

You can use the latest version of bitpim-release for these phones. Make
sure you run Bitpim as root and everything should work.
