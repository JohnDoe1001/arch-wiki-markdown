This article is a general list of applications sorted by category, as a
reference for those looking for packages. Many sections are split
between console and graphical applications.

Tip:  

-   This page exists primarily to make easier search through multiple
    categories. Use links in template on top to view its subcategories
    as separate pages.
-   Please consider installing the pkgstats package, which provides a
    cron job that sends a list of the packages installed on your system,
    along with the architecture and the mirrors you use, to the Arch
    Linux developers in order to help them prioritize their efforts and
    make the distribution even better. The information is sent
    anonymously and cannot be used to identify you. You can view the
    collected data at the Statistics page. More information is available
    in this forum thread.

Note:Applications listed in "Console" sections can have graphical
front-ends. Official ones are currently omitted.

Multi-Protocol Clients

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information:
Comparison of instant messaging clients#Multiprotocol clients

All messengers, that support several networks by means of direct
connections to them, belong to this section.

Many clients listed here (including Pidgin and all it's forks) support
multiple IM networks via libpurple. The number of networks supported by
these clients is very large but they (like any multiprotocol clients)
usually have very limited or no support for network-specific features.

> Pastebin Clients

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information: Pastebin

Pastebin services are often used to paste information into IRC channels
to help with troubleshooting. There are services for both text (e.g.
sprunge.org, pastie.org, codepad.org) and images (e.g. imgur.com,
picpaste.com). Pastebin clients allow you to post directy from the cli
without using a web browser.

Tip:The sprunge pastebin can be accessed directly via curl:

    <command> | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us

There is also a sprunge plugin for oh-my-zsh (a configuration tool for
the Zsh command shell).

Warning:Do not use pastebin.com. It appears to be the most popular site
but it is slow, full of adverts, formats the text badly (it will mess up
your code) and many people can not even open the site due to aggressive
spam filters.

> Emulators

An emulator is a program which serves to replicate the functions of
another platform or system so as to allow applications and games to be
run in environments they were not programmed for. While emulators
themselves are not games in a strict sense, they provide users with the
ability to play games and therefore have been included in this article.

Note:For possibly more up to date selection of emulators, try checking
the AUR 'emulators' category

Warning:Owning an emulator itself is not illegal, but
downloading/sharing copyrighted ROMs and using emulator to run them
without the copyright holder's permission is ILLEGAL. Arch Linux etc. is
not responsible if you get in trouble.
