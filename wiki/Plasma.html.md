containments are capable of containing other widgets called plasmoids.

Get new plasmoids
-----------------

You can get new plasmoids from kde-look.org.

There are a large amount of plasmoids in the AUR, including
kde-extragear-plasmoids-meta which collects popular plasmoids from
kde-look.org and places them in a single package.
