Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open-standard
communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML
(Extensible Markup Language). The protocol was originally named Jabber,
and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for
near-real-time, extensible instant messaging (IM), presence information,
and contact list maintenance.

This article list several XMPP clients and servers.
