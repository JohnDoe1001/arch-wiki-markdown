Arch-Stable/ArchRock
--------------------

In reference to the discussion in this forum thread, the proposition has
been put forth, initially by nagoola, to provide a stable branch or
snapshot of the Arch Linux distribution.

> Aims

Arch-Stable(ArchRock) is aimed at servers, not at desktop/workstation
machines. We will provide a repository that is as stable as possible and
should never break an update.

> Concept

We will provide a repository, which is only updated for security-updates
during a release-cycle(6-12 Months). Feature updates will not be made
during a release-cycle. Each release will be based on the official
Arch-Repositories. We will only be providing the packages from [core] +
some extra packages, which are often used by servers, like apache, php,
mysql, etc.

> Definition

In the context of the Arch-Stable Branch, 'stable' will mean: Packages
should never crash during runtime, be bug-free and should never be
broken by updates.

> Requirements

Staff

1.  Project Leader - Delegate tasks and project direction.
2.  Packagers - Choosing and handling packages to add to the snapshot
    repository.
3.  Testers - Testing the stability of packages, logistics, and
    assistance.
4.  Repository - Will require a server.
5.  Programmers - Code necessary tools.
