cwm
===

cwm is an X11 window manager originally deriving from evilwm. However,
the code base of evilwm did not accommodate the new features that were
being added, so the code was re-written from scratch. cwm aims to be
simple, and offers helpful features such as searching for windows.

xinitrc and Start X at Boot for details).
