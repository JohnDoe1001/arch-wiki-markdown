BCM57780
========

This Broadcom chipset sometimes does not behave well unless you specify
the order of the modules to be loaded. The modules are broadcom and tg3,
the former needing to be loaded first.

These steps should help if your computer has this chipset:

    $ lspci | grep Ethernet
    02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM57780 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe (rev 01)

If your wired networking is not functioning in some way or another, try
unplugging your cable then doing the following (as root):

    # modprobe -r tg3
    # modprobe broadcom
    # modprobe tg3

Now plug you network cable in. If this solves your problems you can make
this permanent in any of the following ways (just pick one!).

Add broadcom and tg3 (in order) to your MODULES line in
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf or /etc/rc.conf:

    MODULES=".. broadcom tg3 .."

If you added it to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf you will have to run this
command:

    # mkinitcpio -p linux

Or you can add these lines to /etc/rc.local (for example):

    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # /etc/rc.local: Local multi-user startup script.
    #

    modprobe -r tg3
    modprobe broadcom
    modprobe tg3

Note:These methods may work for other chipsets, such as BCM57760.
