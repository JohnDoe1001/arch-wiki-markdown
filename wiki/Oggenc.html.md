Oggenc is the official Ogg Vorbis encoder. It reads audio data in either
WAV, FLAC, RAW, or AIFF format and encodes it into an Ogg Vorbis stream.
Although FFmpeg can encode Ogg Vorbis with the libvorbis library, it has
fewer encoding options and can be considered broken (see: Ogg and WebM
technical alert).

Installation
------------

Install the vorbis-tools package from the official repositories or
install a Python alternative, fastoggenc, found in the AUR.
