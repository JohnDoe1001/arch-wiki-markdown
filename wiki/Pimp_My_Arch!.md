Command line Hacking
--------------------

> Boot Sequence

-   You're not still using that /etc/issue from 1983 are you?
-   Qingy
-   Uvesafb
-   fbsplash
-   grub-gfx
-   splashy
-   Plymouth

> Shell and CLI utils

-   Is your PS1 old and stale? New from the makers of Choco-KrautÂ®, it's
    PS1++!
-   Make your .bashrc the envy of everyone else!
-   Why type so much when you can have aliases?

Archers use GUIs?
-----------------

> Transparency

Wish you could make your windows all see-through?

-   Xcompmgr
-   Cairo Composite Manager

> WM Replacement

Like your DE but think your windows have it rough? Change it up! (your
window manager that is)

-   Like your workspaces in that famous cube or just want your windows
    to wobble? Give Compiz a go!
-   Want something that will run fast and slick? Openbox may be the
    answer...

> Dock It

Where else would you put your boat?

-   cairo-dock
-   Avant Window Navigator

> DM Tweaks

> *BOX

-   Check out Ghost1227's Openbox Desktop Workshop and theme archive.

> GNOME

-   Try a new Window Manager! See above
-   Plenty of themes and the like at GNOME-Look.org

> KDE

Hardware hacks
