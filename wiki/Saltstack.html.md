  Summary help replacing me
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This page will give you information on what is Salt Stack and how to install it on Archlinux.

From docs.saltstack.com:

Salt is a new approach to infrastructure management. Easy enought to get
running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of
servers, and fast enough to communicate with them in seconds.

Salt delivers a dynamic communication bus for instrastructures that can
be used for orchestration, remote execution, configuration management
and much more.

Salt is available in Community as salt

Components of Salt Stack
------------------------

Salt is at its core a Remote Execution solution. Running pre-defined or
arbitrary commands on remote hosts. Salt functions on a master/minion
topology. A master server acts as a central control bus for the clients
(called minions), and the minions connect back to the master.

> Salt Master

Turning on the Salt master is easy, just turn it on! The default
configuration is suitable for the vast majority of installations. The
Salt master can be controlled with systemd.

    # systemctl start salt-master

The Salt master can also be started in the foreground in debug mode,
thus greatly increasing the command output:

    # salt-master -l debug

The Salt master needs to bind to 2 TCP network ports on the system,
these ports are 4505 and 4506.

> Salt Minion

The Salt Minion can operate with or without a Salt Master. This wiki
assumes that the minion will be connected to the master. for information
on how to run a master-less minion please see the masterless quickstart
guide: http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/quickstart.html

The Salt minion only needs to be aware of one piece of information to
run, the network location of the master. By default the minion will look
for the DNS name salt for the master, making the easiest approach to set
internal DNS to resolve the name salt back to the Salt Master IP.
Otherwise the minion configuration file will need to be edited, edit the
configuration option master to point to the DNS name or the IP of the
Salt Master.

    /etc/salt/minion

    master: saltmaster.example.com

Now that the master can be found, start the minion in the same way as
the master; with systemd.

    # systemctl start salt-minion

Or in debug mode

    # salt-minion -l debug

> Salt Key

Salt authenticates minion using public key encryption and
authentication. For a minion to start accepting commands from the master
the minion keys need to be accepted. the salt-key command is used to
manage all of the keys on the master. To list the keys that are on the
master run salt-key list command:

    # salt-key -L

The keys that have been rejected, accepted and pending acceptance are
listed. To accept a minion:

    # salt-key -a minion.example.com

Or you can accept all keys at once withÂ :

    # salt-key -A

Salt commands
-------------

After connecting and accepting the minion on the Salt master you can now
send commands to the minion. Salt commands allow for a vast set of
functions to be executed and for specific minion and groups of minions
to be targeted for execution. This makes the salt command very powerful,
but the commannd is also very usable, and easy to understand.

The salt command is compromised of command options, target
specification, the function to execute, and arguments to the function. A
simple command to start with looks like this:

    # salt '*' test.ping

The * is the target, which specifies all minions, and test.ping tells
the minions to run the test.ping function. This salt command will tell
all of the minions to execute the test.ping in parallel and return the
result.

for more commands see documentation or run:

    # salt '*' sys.doc
