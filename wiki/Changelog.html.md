-   Summary of BFS changes: none beyond CK fixing the tickless option
    and porting bfs v0.424 to the 3.5 tree. I therefore reverted the
    temp fix and have RE-ENABLED the ARCH default of tickless enabled.
    Just thought that I would also share some some tangible evidence of
    efficiency gains due to BFS:

 Bump to v3.4.6-1

-   Changelog: We'll need to wait for ck to release a bfs that compiles
    against upstream with NO_HZ as an option. For now, I have removed it
    and set the clock to 300 MHz. If you are unhappy with this, do not
    update to 3.4.6 and stay with 3.4.5-1.

 Bump to v3.4.4-5

-   Notes: Read
    https://www.archlinux.org/news/the-lib-directory-becomes-a-symlink
    and never force an update.
-   Special note: You CANNOT build 3.4.4-5 unless you first update your
    system. To update your system you need to first remove linux-ck
    3.4.4-4 and ANY other ck packages, then update, then rebuild, and
    finally reboot. If this sounds too risky for you, simply install the
    ARCH kernel package and boot into it before removing the ck stuff.

 Bump to v3.4.4-3

-   Changelog: OPTIONAL setting to enable experimental BFS v0.424. Edit
    the PKGBUILD and enable the corresponding option in the header as
    you would for other options. Note that since this is experimental at
    this point, I will not be building it for the repo packages. Once CK
    has deemed it stable, I will. For more on the new BFS, see CK's
    blog: http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2012/07/bfs-424-test.html
-   Summary: 3.4.4-3 and 3.4.4-2 are IDENTICAL unless you enable the
    experimental BFS prior to building!

 Bump to v3.3.4-2

    config/config.x86_64 since I released 3.3.4-1 ahead of their
    release. For compelte changes, see: this webpage.

-   For AUR users only: 3.3.4-2 has optional support for the uksm
    patchset by request. It compiled on my test machine with no issues.
    I also asked CK to give an opinion about this patchset co-existing
    with BFS. Note - Until I can understand more about this patchset, I
    do NOT plan on enabling it by default therefore repo users don't
    need to worry about it. If it is possible to switch this on/off from
    userspace and if the code is 100 % dormant until activated, I will
    think about it.

Note:Since v3.3.1-1 was a sort of pre-released without BFQ, I am
officially releasing 3.3.1-2 including the new and improved BFQ and the
new and improved BFS v0.420.

Note:3.3.0 stable has been released but remember that we need the ck1
patchset for the 3.3 tree + BFQ for the 3.3 tree before I'll update the
repo. Palolo told me it should be a pretty quick release for BFQ.

    forecasting a release of ck1 for the 3.2 tree some time next week!
    This release also doesn't contain the optional BFQ I/O scheduler

 08-Nov-2011 linux-ck-3.1.0-5

Bump to v3.1.0-5

This release is for the AUR only since it contains pre-release patches
which are due out soon and I want [repo-ck] to contain "stable"
packages. See CK's blog edit describing that he is amassing some bug
fixes for BFS v0.414 until he arrives at a critical mass and releases
either a new version of BFS or a new ck2 patchset roll-up. This release
contains 5 such patches shown here:

https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2011-October/021696.html

-   Disabled booting with arch logo (mirrors functionality of ARCH
    kernel).
-   Disabled the custom KC/KCPPFLAGS in the build process since I have
    no direct evidence that they make a bit of difference.

  
 23-Sep-2011 linux-ck-3.0.4-3

This release fixes an error on my part in the PKGBUILD from 3.0.4-2
which caused the BFQ I/O scheduler to be enabled by default rather than
CFQ which is the Arch default. Thanks to sossi for pointing this out.

21-Sep-2011 linux-ck-3.0.4-2

Paolo has released the BFQ patchset for the 3.0.x branch so updated to
include it.

31-Aug-2011 linux-ck-3.0.4-1

Bump to latest version

https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/linux?id=0e64789b388e39515964f046fbaf366de3456d96

20-Aug-2011 linux-ck-3.0.3-4

Bump to 3.0.3-4

Why? Pacman 3.5.4-4 just hit [core] and included a significant change to
the CFLAGS. I am simply bumping to compile again with these new flags
for the repo. Why no 3.0.3-3? I goofed on it and neglected to make the
change to the PKGBUILD aside from just bumping the pkgver AND I got
about 80 % through recompiling all 17 repo package sets before I knew.
Anyway, -3 also went into the AUR and one of the users (ethail) pointed
out the error I made. Anyway, rebuilding and will publish soon.

18-Aug-2011 linux-ck-3.0.3-2

What's different? See line 173 of the PKGBUILD. Added the following into
the make step for bzImage modules modules_install:
KCFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe" KCPPFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"

It is my understanding that this will impart CPU-specific optimization
in the kernel beyond those selected by the config defining the kernel
type. Enjoy!

17-Aug-2011 linux-ck 3.0.3-1

Bump to 3.0.3

16-Aug-2011 linux-ck 3.0.2-1

Bump to 3.0.2

13-Aug-2011 linux-ck 3.0.1-3

Forgot to enable the Arch boot logo in the -2 build. The purpose of the
-3 build is to have this enabled. This is the only change (trivial I
know but I am somewhat OCD).

11-Aug-2011 linux-ck 3.0.1-2

Officially released incorporating CK's 3.0.0-ck1 patchset with BFS
v0.406!

22-Jul-2011 linux-ck 3.0.0-1

It lives! Uploaded a draft PKG as a placeholder waiting for CK and Paolo
to release their respective patchsets for the 3,x release.

  
 19-Jul-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.3-3

Bump to 2.6.39.3-3

This release is more or less identical to the previous one with one key
difference: the virtualbox modules won't compile bug has been fixed.
Full details on page 14 of the discussion thread. Packages should be
online around 6:00 EST.

14-Jul-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.3-2

Bump to 2.6.39.3-2

No internal differences between the -1 and -2 release. The changes are
to the packages, not their contents. xclaude made me aware of a small
bug in my packaging script that didn't get the conflict arrays right for
some packages. I fixed it but it required me bumping the package to -2
and rebuilding. So here we are with -2 :)

09-Jul-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.3-1

Bump to 2.6.39.3-1

27-Jun-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.2-1

Bump to 2.6.39.2-1

11-Jun-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.1-3

Bump to 2.6.39.1-3

I had to bump to -3 because I added an additional arch to the repo (k10
optimized) and the only way I would make sure that all packages got an
update to their respective conflicts arrays was to rebuild EVERYTHING.
Repo users will get the update but AUR users have no reason to
build/update unless you like to watch kernel packages compile :)

The repo now hosts the following packages/CPU-specific optimized builds.

kernel, kernel-headers, nvidia, and broadcom-wl in the following
flavors:

-   x86_64: generic, atom, core2, k8, k10
-   i686: generic, atom, core2, k7, k8, k10, p4, pentm

  
 09-Jun-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.1-2

Bump to 2.6.39.1-2

The ONLY difference is that this PKGBUILD gives a new option to enable
the "classic" blue Arch logo at boot time which will replace the Linux
Tux logo we've had since tpowa removed the custom logo in 2.6.38.8. Repo
users have this enabled by default by popular demand.

06-Jun-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39.1-1

Bump to latest version.

05-Jun-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39-10

Bump to latest version bfs which is v0.406 as well the ck2 patchset.
Previous instabilities with plugged I/O flushing have been fixed.

http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/06/2639-ck2-bfs-0406.html

02-Jun-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38-9

Looks like CK made some progress on the hardlock issues affecting 2.6.39
by releasing test9 which I have added to 2.6.39-9 that just published to
the AUR. If you elect to build this kernel, please report your
experiences, good and bad, to CK on his blog which will help the
community:
http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/06/2639-bfs-test-9-is-this-one.html

Note that the repo doesn't get this since the patch is an option. Once
CK calls the code "stable" he will iterate the bfs version and I will
then include it.

30-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38-8

Looks like CK made some progress on the hardlock issues affecting 2.6.39
by releasing bfs404-recheck_unplugged which I have added to 2.6.39-8
that just published to the AUR. If you elect to build this kernel,
please report your experiences, good and bad, to CK on his blog which
will help the community:

26-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.39-7

Bump to 2.6.39-7

Includes an option to compile with ck's new bfs v.404 test7 patch for
those of us with these random hardlocks associated with Virtualbox and
Chromium. This patch tweaks the new plugged I/O flushing. For more or to
discuss this patch, see:

Bump to latest version from mainline. Also includes bfs v0.404 from ck.
For details, see: http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/05/2639-ck1.html

  
 13-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.6-3

Bump to latest version with a fixed libata regression
https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/?id=82d1e0060dfe93404bd54305da18469d51e4ee13

For repo-only versions, the package now comes with the BFQ I/O scheduler
built as a module which users can enable at will. Read the section for
instructions to load it and enable it.

  
 11-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.6-2

Minor change to the config and config.x86_64: set the
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER option from enabled to disabled. Result will be a
slightly smaller and faster kernel image without kernel debugging
information (precise oopses/stacktraces/warnings). Note that as of gcc
4.6.0+, the -O2 switch adds the corresponding -fomit-frame-pointer
switch to your CFLAGS, so this kernel option seems a bit redundant.

10-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.6-1

Bump to latest version.
https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/?id=6d930e1582988016b3f6ac119ffcbfe0bfb4809b

  
 07-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.5-2

Added a line to the PKGBUILD that appends user defined CFLAGS to the
KCFLAGS since, as falconindy pointed out in this thread (see post #185),
the kernel does not use the userland CFLAGS defined in /etc/makepkg.conf
as we thought.

  
 03-May-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.5-1

https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/?id=f13814c4550d17d05d2cc36bd01596aecc24b5aa

Also, updated BFS from v0.400 --> v0.401

15-Apr-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.2-6

Major f*ckup on my part: I included the WRONG config/config.x86_64 when
I packaged the -5 release. The 1000 Hz/tickless=n options were still
there. This release has the correct settings! Once you update and
reboot, you can verify that you have tickless enabled (CONFIG_NO_HZ=y)
and that the ARCH default value of 300 Hz is in use (CONFIG_HZ_300=y and
CONFIG_HZ=300) from the following command:

    $ zcat /proc/config.gz | grep HZ

14-Apr-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.2-5

Reverted to the ARCH default configs (plus BFS) based on several reports
from the community regarding significant decreases in battery life for
laptop users.

13-Apr-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.2-4

Changed the configs based on CK's suggestions:

1.  Disabled dynamic ticks (ARCH default is enabled).
2.  Tick rate = 1000 Hz (ARCH default is 300 Hz).

All other options are set to the ARCH defaults outlined in the main
kernel's config files. Why the changes? See CK's [BFS configuration
FAQ]. These settings are based on his recommended configuration for
"Desktop."

10-Apr-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.2-3

Added official CK3 patchset which includes the BFS v0.400. Functionally,
there is no difference between -3 and -2.
http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/04/bfs-0400.html

10-Apr-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.2-2

Added BFS v0.400

30-Mar-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.2-1

Bump to latest version git-svn-id: eb2447ed-0c53-47e4-bac8-5bc4a241df78

29-Mar-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.1-3

Downgraded to ck1 patchset due to regression introduced by the BFS
v0.370. For more, see CK's blog:
http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/03/2638-ck1-bfs-0363.html

26-Mar-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.38.1-2

Added CK's bfs363-test2 patch to the standard ck1 patchset. This further
refines the bfs on a per-cpu frequency scaling basis and is enabled by
default. See CK's blog entry:
http://ck-hack.blogspot.com/2011/03/bfs-and-optimising-global-scheduler-for.html

Files affected:

-   kernel/sched_bfs.c
-   include/linux/sched.h
-   drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_conservative.c
-   drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c
-   drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c

Excerpt from the blog, "Not only will the workload complete faster, but
almost certainly battery usage will be reduced. It also has no effect
without cpu frequency scaling, and no effect on single CPU machines, but
the more cores and threads you have, the greater the benefit. Since some
new Linux distributions now no longer even allow you to change the
governor and just set it to ondemand by default, this change is
something that will be essential."

use this release.

19-Feb-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.37.1-1

Bump to latest version - thanks to koeleck for providing [this patch] to
fix the ck2 patchset!

13-Feb-2011 kernel26-ck 2.6.37-7

Includes ck2 patchset not ck1 patchset. From ck's blog:

"I've put up a small updated -ck version for 2.6.37. There are only 2
changes: 1. The build fix for it not compiling with CPU HOTPLUG
disabled, and 2. I've dropped the patch called
mm-make_swappiness_really_mean_it.patch . This second patch broke a
while back and I never noticed because I had swap disabled, sorry. It
works better with it disabled. Note that the ubuntu packages I recently
made available include this change which I quietly snuck in, but I will
make ck2 packages officially available just to avoid confusion ;) If
you've built your own 2.6.37-ck1 then I recommend upgrading only if you
have swap enabled on your machine (which most people still do).
Alternatively if you built it with CPU_HOTPLUG enabled just to make it
build, then you _can_ upgrade to this version to build with it disabled
but you won't notice a difference with the feature disabled - your
kernel will only be slightly smaller. It might be a few nanoseconds
faster.."

12-Feb-2011 kernel26-ck/headers-ck 2.6.37-6

rebuild against latest glibc, binutils git-svn-id: 109724
eb2447ed-0c53-47e4-bac8-5bc4a241df78

I am reading this as glibc 2.13-3 and binutils 2.21-4, both of which are
currently in [testing] need to be installed prior to kernel compilation.
I can install both of these testing packages on my machine, and compile
for the repo, but individual users will have to install those packages,
THEN compile their own kernels... therefore both glibc and binuntils
have been temporarily added to the deps array in the PKGBUILD. Users
will need to snag them either by enabling [testing] in /etc/pacman.conf
or simply by downloading via pacman -U.

29-Jan-2011 kernel26-ck/headers-ck 2.6.37-5

fix module-init-tools dependency git-svn-id:
eb2447ed-0c53-47e4-bac8-5bc4a241df78

It's a very MINOR change. Same ARCH patch set (-4) and same config
files. Other than that change, it's identical to -4.
