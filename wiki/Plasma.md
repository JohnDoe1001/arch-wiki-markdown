Plasma
======

Plasma is the component of the KDE project that actually displays the
desktop (i.e. wallpapers, panels, etc) using 'containments'. The
containments are capable of containing other widgets called plasmoids.

Get new plasmoids
-----------------

You can get new plasmoids from kde-look.org.

There are a large amount of plasmoids in the AUR, including
kde-extragear-plasmoids-meta which collects popular plasmoids from
kde-look.org and places them in a single package.
