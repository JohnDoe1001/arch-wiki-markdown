Emerald
=======

The Emerald Window Decorator is a custom window decorator shipped with
Compiz that allows for theming and full composite window decorations
with the use of engines. Emerald allows for all sorts of different
configurations and layouts of buttons, look, title bars and frames.
Emerald Window Decorator is completely independent of any desktop, and
you specify your own themes to use for it. The Decoration plugin must be
enabled in order for Emerald Window Decorator to function.
