Bug Day/2005
============

Bug Squashing Day is a day dedicated to raising awareness about our
overflowing bugtracker. The goal of the day is to get the community
involved in trying to help us eliminate as many bugs as possible. This
page is to answer some questions about Bug Squashing Day, and to provide
you with the information you need to know in order to help rid us of
some of these pesky critters.

When?
-----

Bug Squshing Day takes place during the first Sunday of every month.
There was once a question as to what time exactly it starts on Sunday,
and most people agreed that it doesn't really matter. So if it's Sunday
where you are...it's Bug Squashing Day.

Where?
------

Well the bugs themselves are hiding at
https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?project=1 .  
 Discussion about the bugs should be taking place on IRC in the
#archlinux-bugs channel (on freenode). We will try to man the channel
with at least one developer at all times during bug squashing day, so
that bugs can be fixed and closed.

Who?
----

Everyone is allowed, invited, and encouraged to participate in Bug
Squashing Day.

Why?
----

Well, we all love Arch, otherwise we would not be using it. Being so, we
should all make an effort to keep it healthy. Helping us fix bugs is one
way that you can do just that, and brings community participation into
an otherwise monotonous and boring (and occasionally difficult) task.
Also, having so many people focus on killing bugs all at once for a day
helps empty out the tracker a bit, there are more and more bugs in there
as Arch grows, so more resources are needed to handle them as well. The
community is Arch's best and biggest resource, why not use it?
