> Work environment

The default installation of Arch provides Bash as shell interpreter and
does not contain any Desktop Environment, therefore forces users to
choose one themselves. Most Arch boxes run some X11 Window Manager
and/or Desktop Environment, but of course there are still people who
prefer doing everyday tasks in bare console.

> Emulators

An emulator is a program which serves to replicate the functions of
another platform or system so as to allow applications and games to be
run in environments they were not programmed for.

Note:For possibly more up to date selection of emulators, try checking
the AUR 'emulators' category

Warning:Owning an emulator itself is not illegal, but
downloading/sharing copyrighted ROMs and using emulator to run them
without the copyright holder's permission is illegal. Arch Linux is not
responsible if you get in trouble.
