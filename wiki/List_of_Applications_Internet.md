> Pastebin Clients

See the Wikipedia article on this subject for more information: Pastebin

Pastebin services are often used to paste information into IRC channels
to help with troubleshooting. There are services for both text (e.g.
sprunge.org, pastie.org, codepad.org) and images (e.g. imgur.com,
picpaste.com). Pastebin clients allow you to post directy from the cli
without using a web browser.

Tip:The sprunge pastebin can be accessed directly via curl:

    <command> | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us

There is also a sprunge plugin for oh-my-zsh (a configuration tool for
the Zsh command shell).

Warning:Do not use pastebin.com. It appears to be the most popular site
but it is slow, full of adverts, formats the text badly (it will mess up
your code) and many people can not even open the site due to aggressive
spam filters.

-   Curlpaste — A utility to post text files to a number of pastebin
    sites using curl and Lua. Servers: pastebin.ca, codepad.org,
    dpaste.com and fpaste.org.

-   Elmer — A pastebin client similar to wgetpaste and curlpaste, except
