 LMMS is a free cross-platform software which allows you to produce
music with your computer. This covers creating melodies and beats,
synthesizing and mixing sounds and arranging samples. You can have fun
with your MIDI keyboard and much more – all in a user-friendly and
modern interface. Furthermore LMMS comes with many ready-to-use
instrument and effect plugins, presets and samples.

Installation

lmms is in the offical Archlinux repository, but you may also need the
git "master branch" version for the newest improvements.

------------------

If VST support won't work on x86_64 systems, you can always build
lmms-git from AUR with the melchips's vst fix
patch(https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=166627).
