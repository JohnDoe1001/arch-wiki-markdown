  [Tango-two-arrows.png]   This article or section  [Tango-two-arrows.png]
                           is a candidate for       
                           merging with List of     
                           Applications.            
                           Notes: This article      
                           doesn't offer more       
                           information than an      
                           entry in List of         
                           Applications, although I 
                           think we'd need to       
                           create a new section for 
                           this kind of             
                           applications. (Discuss)
