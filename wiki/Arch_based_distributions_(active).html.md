> Chakra

"Our goal with Chakra is to provide an operating system for desktops
that is easy to use, but still has all the functionality, clarity, power
and speediness of a KISS operating system. In the long term, we want to
build an operating system based on Arch Linux that meets most
requirements desktop users have today, like easy installation of
software, graphical system administration, configuring power management
on mobile devices, or sharing an internet connection."  

Source: The Chakra Project - About

Chakra is a distribution heavily geared towards KDE4. The fresh install
is GTK-free. All GTK apps are installed in a sandbox-like environment
known as bundles. The project seeks for ease of use, using several
home-grown graphical utilites for installing and maintanence. Warning:
it is still under heavy development, nevertheless it is already suitable
for everyday use. Expect some changes in the base system in the near
future, like switching from Pacman to Akabei.

Meta Distributions
------------------

> archiso

archiso is a very simple set of bash scripts that allow for building
live bootable CD/DVD/USB images based on Arch Linux. It uses a small
uncomplicated code base and is actively developed. archiso is the tool
used by Arch Linux to generate the official CD/USB images. It is a very
generic tool, so it could potentially be used to generate anything from
rescue systems, to install disks, to special interest live systems, and
who knows what else. Simply put, if it involves Arch on a shiny coaster,
it can do it.

Arch Influenced Distros
-----------------------

> Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a run-from-RAM linux distribution. Its original target
was small appliances like routers, VPN gateways, or embedded x86
devices. However, it supports hosting other Linux guest OSes under
VServer control, making it an attractive hosting solution as well.
Though Alpine Linux may not actually be based on Arch, its build system
is undoubtably inspired by Arch. 23

> Enlisy

Enlisy is an i686 optimized Linux distribution for Pentium 2 based
processors and higher. It is also as simple as possible when it comes to
the construction of its underlying core. Enlisy uses its own package
manager Apport, which is is based on Libpysrc and Libpypac, which are
inspired by Arch's package manager Pacman. Enlisy also uses InitNG for
the init system.

"The idea behind KaOS is to create a tightly integrated rolling and
transparent distribution for the modern desktop, build from scratch with
a very specific focus. Focus on one DE (KDE), one toolkit (Qt), one
architecture (x86_64) plus a focus on evaluating and selecting the most
suitable tools and applications. All work is geared toward packaging,
not developing new tools or applications."
