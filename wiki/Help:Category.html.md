Help:Category
=============

Every article must be categorized: categories are displayed at the
bottom of each article. This HOWTO will explain how to set page
category, how to create missing categories pages and how to move a page
to a different category. For the related style rules, see Help:Style.

Articles and categories used as examples in this article are not real.
If you want to practice moving while reading this HOWTO, find a real
page you want to move.

Note:Everything that is discussed in this article applies to categories
themselves in quite the same way (i.e. categories can also be
categorized).

Set page category
-----------------

Click "edit" at the top of the page. Add the following to the beginning
of the text:

    [[Category:Some Category]]

Create new category page
------------------------

After you have saved the page, you will see a "Category: Some Category"
link at the bottom of the article. If this category does not exists, it
will show in red color. Click the red link to go to the newly created
category.

Set it to be a sub-category of a parent category:

    [[Category:Parent Category]]

Save the category page. If "Category:Parent Category" already existed.
Your job is done. If not, you have to add this page to an appropriate
category by doing the same, only the category name is different now.

Move a page into a different category
-------------------------------------

To move a page into a category, edit the page's
[[Category:Some category]] line.

For example, let us move a fictional page "ArchWiki Tutorial (Magyar)"
to an appropriate fictional category. (Moving to existing categories is
basically the same as moving to non-existing categories.)

Click "edit" at the top of the page. Find the following line at the
beginning of the text:

    [[Category:Help]]

change it to:

    [[Category:Help (Magyar)]]

Save the page by clicking the "Save page" button just below the edit
box.

i18n category name
