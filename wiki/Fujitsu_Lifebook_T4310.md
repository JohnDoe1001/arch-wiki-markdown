Installation
------------

Consult the standard documentation (official and unofficial) on Arch
Linux installation for general installation steps.

    Original install using '2011.08.19 installation media' with kernel 3.0.1.  Most everything worked out of the box. Dated: September 01 2011.

  

> Hardware Modules

-   i915 Integrated Intel Graphics

Note: This laptop uses an integrated Intel graphics chip. And will
require the x86-video-intel driver.

-   ahci Hotplug Sata Drives

> Suggestions

Make sure to run through the Laptop wiki

There is a module for the bezel buttons in the AUR however I have had no
luck building it thus far.

> What works and what does not

The touchpad is being detected as a PS/2 mouse. With older kernels this
was not an issue. Installation of the x86-input-synaptics driver adds no
touchpad functionality. Vertical scroll and click work under the PS/2
profile however.

With this installation of x86-input-wacom dual digitizer works within
Gnome 3 without further configuration.

Modular bay works as expected... tested with 6 cell battery, modular
drive mount, and DVD-R Drive.
