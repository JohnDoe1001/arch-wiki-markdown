Kerbal Space Program
====================

Since version 0.19, Kerbal Space Program includes a native Linux
version. However, only Ubuntu 12.04 is officialy supported, so it may
not work on Arch Linux out of the box.

Known issues
------------

> Game never progresses past initial loading

To fix this, set:

    LC_ALL=C

> No text display

The game requires Arial and Arial Black fonts, provided in the
ttf-ms-fonts AUR package.
