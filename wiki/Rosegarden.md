Installation
------------

rosegarden is available in the [extra] repository. Be sure to install a
MIDI setup first.

Usage
-----

> With Timidity and Pulseaudio

Launch Timidity as a daemon before launching RosegardenÂ :

    $ timidity -iA

This way, Rosegarden will not launch jackd and you'll still be able to
hear sound from other running apps.
