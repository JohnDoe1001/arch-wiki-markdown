Wingo is a fully featured true hybrid window manager that supports
per-monitor workspaces, and neither the floating or tiling modes are
after thoughts. This allows one to have tiling on one workspace while
floating on the other. Wingo can be scripted with its own command
language, is completely themeable, and supports user defined hooks.
Wingo is written in Go and has no runtime dependencies.

The development version can be installed from the wingo-git package.
