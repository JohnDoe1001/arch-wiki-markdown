Xephyr
======

Xephyr is a nested X server that runs as an X application

Installation
------------

xorg-server-xephyr is available from official repositories. Install it
with pacman.

Execution
---------

If you wish to run a nested X window, you'll need to specify a display.

    $ Xephyr -br -ac -noreset -screen 800x600Â :1

This will launch a new Xephyr window with a DISPLAY of ":1". In order to
launch an application in that window, you would need to specify that
display.

    $ DISPLAY=:1 xterm

If you want to launch another WM, spectrwm for example, you would type:

    $ DISPLAY=:1 spectrwm
