Cairo Composite Manager is a versatile and extensible composite manager
which uses cairo for rendering. Plugins can be used to add some cool
effects to your desktop. It's capable of, but not limited to, rendering
of drop shadows, setting window transparency, menu and window
animations, and applying decorations.

Like Xcompmgr, it does not replace an existing window manager, which
makes it ideal for users of lightweight window managers, like Openbox
and Fluxbox, who seek a more elegant desktop.

Prerequisites
-------------

To make use of Cairo Composite Manager, it requires the following:

-   Xorg must be installed, configured and running
-   Composite must be enabled via graphics drivers, AIGLX

Installation
------------

cairo-compmgr from [community] is no longer available, but you can
install cairo-compmgr-git development version from the AUR.

There are no errors on compile with removed gconf, and it runs fine.
However, it is not possible to remove dependency on vala as it will not
compile in that case. If you remove gconf, you need to remove the last 3
lines in PKGBUILD, the ones mentioning gconf.

Configuration
-------------

To start Cairo Composite Manager, simply run:

    $ cairo-compmgr 

To have it load every time you start X, you can add it to your
~/.xinitrcÂ :

    cairo-compmgr &

Once started, Cairo Composite Manager installs itself in your systray
and you can configure it by by right-clicking the systray icon.

If you just want Xcompmgr's behaviour, you can disable a lot of the
plugins straightaway. Be patient while Cairo Composite Manager unloads a
plugin, it might stall your screen for a moment.
