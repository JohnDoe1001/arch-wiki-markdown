Zero Install
============

Zero Install is a package manager that allows a single software package
to run on many operating systems and distributions without repackaging
for each platform. According to its website Zero Install "allows
software developers to publish programs directly from their own
web-sites, while supporting features familiar from centralized
distribution repositories such as shared libraries, automatic updates
and digital signatures" A Zero Install package can be ran as a normal
user without installing it on your system.
