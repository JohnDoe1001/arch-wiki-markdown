Introduction
============

This article is intended as a sandbox of ideas for the Arch Linux
website. Feel free to add suggestions and any thoughts you might have
about how the Arch Linux website can be improved.

This article is part of the DeveloperWiki.

Ideas and Suggestions
=====================

Reorganize link structure

Reorganize the website link hierarchy, such as proposed in
DeveloperWiki:Website Hierarchy Proposal

OpenID

Implement an OpenID-like identity system for the official Arch Linux
websites.

-   If we could integrate login/pass throughout AUR, Wiki, Forums, and
    Bugs this way ... well I'm afraid I'd get a bit moist. Â :)

-   Might also consider Mozilla Persona[1], which should be easier to
    implement than full blown openID.

Developer/Fellows profiles

Condense the developer profiles pages, reducing photo sizes and dropping
relatively unimportant fields such as: Favourite Distros, Year of Birth,
Interests, Other Contacts, etc.

-   I don't like this idea. I like any distro that has a soul and flavor
    to it. Sterile "strictly-business" design and community should be
    left to the Wall Street distros.

Navbar for internal Arch sites

Look at the feasibility of creating a unified navbar that would sit at
the top of all Arch community sites (bbs.archlinux, wiki.archlinux,
etc.), providing an exact copy of the main website hierarchy via
drop-down menus (using CSS of course).

Embed Ads by Google into content

Consider placing the Ads by Google inside actual page content (or at
least below the navigation) and removing it from the header entirely.

The ads have been removed some time ago due to Google having issues with
Arch violating the terms of service or something. -- Karol 15:13, 27

URI Linking

Implement a pacman:// URI as an option to quickly let users quickly
install packages from webpages and same the functionality for AUR
packages. 9mmtylenol
