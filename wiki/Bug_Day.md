About
-----

Bug Day is a day dedicated to raising awareness about our overflowing
bug tracker. The goal of the day is to get the community involved in
trying to help us eliminate as many bugs as possible.

> When?

Bug Day happens whenever a developer gets bored.

> Where?

The bugs themselves are documented on the bug tracker

Discussion about the bugs should be taking place in #archlinux-bugs on
IRC. We will try to have at least one developer active during bug day.

> Who?

Everyone is allowed, invited, and encouraged to participate in Bug Day.
