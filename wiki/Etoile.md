About Étoilé
------------

From Étoilé webpage

Étoilé is a user environment designed from the ground up around the
things people do with computers: create, collaborate,and learn.

Without implementation details like files and operating-system processes
polluting the computer's UI, Étoilé users will be able to:

-   have revision history for all objects in the system
-   collaborate with other people on any type of document (text,
    drawing, code, etc.)
-   shape their own workflow by combining the provided Services
-   use a system that is closer to their mental model of how computers
    should work
-   Étoilé is open-source (MIT/BSD licensed) and built on GNUstep - it
    will be portable to most operating systems.

Obtaining Étoilé
----------------

Currently Étoilé is available in the AUR.

etoile
    "Stable" version
etoile-svn
    "Trunk" (Unstable) version

Configuring Étoilé
------------------

Currently the installation script, also called "setup.sh", is not very
mature and can cause problems if used in Arch Linux, because packages
are installed in /usr not /usr/local (the script assumes that you have
installed it there) so you have to manually adjust the script.
