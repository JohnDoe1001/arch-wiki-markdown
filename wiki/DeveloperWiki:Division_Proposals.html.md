Ports Division
==============

    **Status:** ***PROPOSED***

Purpose
-------

The Ports division will organize all of the Arch Linux porting efforts
to other architectures. They will make decisions surrounding multiple
architecture methods, bring together all porting knowledge, and
generally be accessible to anyone interested in helping out. This will
also be where discussion and development surrounding pacbuild will be
organized.

Code
----

PRT -- All communication strictly related to porting ideas will be
marked with a [PRT] at the beginning of the subject line.

Kernel Division
===============

    **Status:** ***PROPOSED***

Purpose
-------

A division specifically for kernel/udev/boot time related changes. As an
active division, changes are talked about and nothing is really
implemented until most think it's a good idea.

Code
----

KRN -- All communication strictly related to kernel, udev, and boot time
issues will be marked with a [KRN] at the beginning of the subject line.
