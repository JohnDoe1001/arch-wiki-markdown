ArchWiki:Contributing
=====================

ArchWiki strives to be a clear, comprehensive and professional model of
documentation. In order to reach that goal we have to organize the job
in a rational and functional way: this article tries to explain
schematically what are the most important tasks you can give your help
to accomplish.

This is a community effort, but if you take on the task seriously, a
formal position as a wiki maintainer may be in order.

Note:Always use the Edit Summary when editing articles, see
Help:Style#Edit summary. If you intend to perform large changes that
involve several articles, please discuss your plans first in an
appropriate discussion page.

Easy to start jobs
------------------

Here are some easy jobs you can start with before moving to more
difficult ones.

> Fix double redirects

1.  Read this section to understand what redirects are.
2.  Check out Special:DoubleRedirects to see if there are any.
3.  For example, if you see
    Pastebin Clients (Edit) →‎ Common Applications →‎ List of Applications,
    it means Pastebin Clients redirects to Common Applications, and
    Common Applications redirects to List of Applications. Therefore,
    Pastebin Clients is a double redirect.
4.  To fix it, edit Pastebin Clients and change
    #REDIRECT [[Common Applications]] to
     #REDIRECT [[List of Applications]] to skip the middleman.
5.  Enter an edit summary such as "Fixed double redirect" and save.

> Use internal links

Replace external links that point to the ArchWiki by internal links.

-   list of https links

Creating
--------

Ensure you understand the philosophy of ArchWiki and think about what
others may want to read (see ArchWiki:Requests for ideas). As mentioned,
the wiki's scope is quite wide.

Talk to the admins for help coordinating major projects.

Improving
---------

Content editing, proofreading, and updating are never-ending tasks on
any wiki. If you want to help, just register an account and start
performing your magic.

-   Help fulfilling requests.
-   Add content to stubs and expand incomplete or poorly-written
    articles.
-   Correct inaccurate or outdated content, spelling, grammar, language,
    and style.
-   Update the FAQ with relevant questions from the forum and remove
    obsolete questions.

Maintenance
-----------

-   Help patrolling the Recent Changes, fixing questionable edits and
    reporting spam.
-   Flag articles with appropriate article status templates, like
    {{Deletion}}, {{Out of date}}, {{Accuracy}}, etc.
-   Add some articles to your watchlist and protect them against
    counter-productive edits.
-   Participate in discussions in the various talk pages: most users
    will be interested in following the most recent posts to generic
    discussions at this link. Maintenance-specific posts are instead
    listed in [1], [2], [3] and [4]; furthermore, ArchWiki:Requests is
    used as a talk page despite its namespace.

Organizing
----------

Sorting, categorizing, and moving articles around has become a major
task for all wiki maintainers implementing and improving the category
tree.

-   Reduce and combine duplicate pages.
-   Improve wiki navigation.
-   Categorize uncategorized pages, uncategorized categories and wanted
    categories. See Help:Style#Categories and Help:Style#Category pages.
-   Fix broken and double redirects.
-   See Special:SpecialPages for other useful cleanup tools.

Translating
-----------

Add or improve translations; ensure that translations are in sync with
each other. Some languages have started collaboration projects (see list
below) to efficiently organize the translation of the articles. Please
consider joining your language's Translation Team or at least informing
it when you are starting translating an article.

-   ArchWiki Translation Team
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (Español)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (Hrvatski)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (Italiano)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (Polski)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (日本語)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (简体中文)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (Ελληνικά)
-   ArchWiki Translation Team (Català)

Some languages use external wiki, they may require different steps for
translation. Help:i18n has a list of external wikis.

> Special messages translation

There are some special messages used in Arch Wiki, please provide their
translation for your language in the following link:

-   Also in (Message in Categories tree): Add translation here
-   Talkpagetext : Add translation here

Brainstorming
-------------

If unsure where to begin, or you feel awkward about editing other
people's work, you may also contribute by posting ideas and suggestions
at Forum & Wiki discussion section of the Arch Linux Forums.

Back-end maintenance
--------------------

Use the Arch Linux Bugtracker to report bugs and contribute fixes and
improvements to the MediaWiki codebase.
