Installing
----------

elinks is available from the official repositories.

Usage
-----

Start elinks with

    elinks

or, if you want to start a specific website:

    elinks foo.bar.org

Some basic keys are

    g Open URL-dialog
    t Open new tab
    > Change tab
    c Close current tab
    Esc Show toolbar

Configuration
-------------

ELinks is capable of using external programs for various tasks, one of
them is showing pictures. TheÂ %-sign is handled as filename (or URL).

    ~/.elinks/elinks.conf

    set mime.extension.jpg="image/jpeg"
    set mime.extension.jpeg="image/jpeg"
    set mime.extension.png="image/png"
    set mime.extension.gif="image/gif"
    set mime.extension.bmp="image/bmp"

    set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix.ask = 1
    set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix-xwin.ask = 0
     
    set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix.block = 1
    set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix-xwin.block = 0 
     
    set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix.program = "ADDYOURTERMINALPICTUREVIEWERHERE %"
    set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix-xwin.program = "ADDYOURXPICTUREVIEWERHERE %"

    set mime.type.image.jpg = "image_viewer"
    set mime.type.image.jpeg = "image_viewer"
    set mime.type.image.png = "image_viewer"
    set mime.type.image.gif = "image_viewer"
    set mime.type.image.bmp = "image_viewer"

Using ELinks with Tor
---------------------

ELinks does not support SOCKS directly, so alternatives are to either
invoke ELinks thus torify elinks or install privoxy from the official
repositories and use it for forwarding to Tor's SOCKS proxy, first by
adding the following line to your /etc/privoxy/config:

    forward-socks5 / localhost:9050 .

Restart privoxy.service and then entering the following lines to your
~/.elinks/elinks.conf:

    set protocol.http.proxy.host = "127.0.0.1:8118"
    set protocol.https.proxy.host = "127.0.0.1:8118"

Note:The above assumes that Tor is using port 9050 and that privoxy is
listening on port 8118
