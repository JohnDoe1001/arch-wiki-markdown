                           Reason: As of PHP 5.2.0, 
                           the JSON extension is    
                           bundled and compiled     
                           into PHP by default.

RelaXX requires the JSON extension:

    # pecl install json

Edit /etc/php/php.ini and add or uncomment the following line to enable
the extension:

    extension=json.so
