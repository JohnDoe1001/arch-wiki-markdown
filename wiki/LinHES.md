LinHES
======

LinHES (Linux Home Entertainment System) is a distribution heavily based
on Arch, centered around MythTV designed for Home Theater PCs (HTPCs)
use. The expressed goal of LinHES is to provide a HES-appliance feel to
your HTPC. Most if not all of the system configuration and operation can
be accomplished via your remote control. Users can go from a blank
system to a fully functional MythTV system in 15-20 minutes. LinHES
makes use of mythvantage for easy configuration and modification. There
is a service menu accessible right from the mythtv GUI where users can
configure most of the machine right from their couch via their remote
control.

-   Current stable release: R7.4 (9-Aug-2012)
-   Creator/lead developer: Cecil Watson
-   Package Maintainers/developers: Greg Frost, James Meyer, Nathan

Divergence from the Arch Way
----------------------------

LinHES is meant to be an appliance and is targeted at Linux neophytes.
As such, it is noteworthy to mention that although LinHES is based on
Arch, LinHES doesn't conform to the Arch Way. For example:

-   LinHES implements pacman's abilities more broadly philosophically.

Pacman under LinHES can and does modify package config files/other files
for the user without the user's need to do so manually as is the Arch
Way. Additionally, some LinHES packages will modify files owned by other
LinHES packages. Both of these examples represent a divergence from the
Arch Way that might not sit well with some experienced Arch users. On
its own, neither example represents a "bad" thing, but they should be
documented for the afore mentioned niche community.

Brief History
-------------

The predecessor to LinHES is Knoppmyth (KM). As its name implies, the
initial releases of Knoppmyth were based on Knoppix, but the latest
incarnations are not, although the brand-name "KnoppMyth" has been
retained. From the knoppmyth wiki:

"Knoppix itself is an adaptation of the Debian Linux distribution,
Knoppmyth therefore is another project that has spiralled off into its
own domain. These days it would be more correct to call KnoppMyth a
specialized and heavily customized Debian derivative, as there is very
little Knoppix left."

The first release of KM was on 09-Aug-2003 (R1) and was based on MythTV
0.10. The latest stable incarnation of KM is R5.5 which was released on
06-Jul-2008 and is based on MythTV 0.21.2. The first release of LinHES
(R6) went gold (stable) on the 26-Sept-2009, version R6.01.00 being
officially released.

Both LinHES and KM can be installed and function on almost any "modern"
computer. There are a set of components that constitute the so-called,
"Knoppmyth Reference Platform" which is nothing more than a set of
hardware that is known and certified to work out-of-the-box with KM. The
hardware specifications are completely open.

Development on KM has halted and all efforts are focusing on LinHES.
That said, KM R5.5 is still a very robust Mythtv-Distro.

> Version History of KM/LinHES

Since the first release in 2003, there have been about a dozen major and
minor versions of KM.

> R5.5/R6.x Differences Table and Equivalent Commands

This section intends to capture the differences between R5.x and R6.x as
well as capture some equivalent shell commands for the user familiar
with the R5 series.

Startup Scripts It is noteworthy to mention that /etc/rc.local does NOT
get called at boot as it does under Arch. Instead, LinHES uses
/etc/runit/1.local for startup scripts.

Required Hardware
-----------------

A LinHES system can use most modern and "semi-modern" hardware. Some
users report a fully functional system driven by an antiquated AMD
Athlon (800 MHz)/nforce2 CPU/MB. For HD-playback one will need a more
powerful CPU or a GPU capable of VDPAU such as an NVIDIA 8400GS, 9500GT,
or GF 210. For a complete table of NVIDIA cards and their VDPAU support,
see this table. Intel Atom-based PCs are also popular among LinHES users
for their low heat output and ultra low power consumption. Again, this
low-power CPU needs to be paired with a VDPAU compatible GPU or else
view HD content will not be possible. Most Atom MB/CPU combos are paired
with one, for example, see offerings by Intel and Zotac.

LinHES can also run in a virtual machine (verified to work in Virtual
Box v3.0.10) if would-be users would prefer to test drive it in a
sandbox.

R6 Installation Walk-through (Brief)
------------------------------------

Boot the LinHES CD or USB media.

-   Screen 1: Select the "Install or Upgrade" option. If upgrading, you
    will go directly to screen 10 and everything will be processed
    automatically based on your backups.

Warning: If upgrading from an R5.x box, make sure that you run the
mythbackup script before you attempt an install of R6.

-   Screen 2: Select a target file-system

-   Screen 3: Select the type of install (Full/auto or Upgrade). Also
    assign partition sizes for the OS, swap, and data partitions. The
    defaults should be fine. Users can also select which file-system
    format is used. Currently the default is for ext3, but other options
    such as ext4/RFS/XFS/JFS are also available.

-   Screen 4: Assign a host-name

Note: Make sure you are satisfied with the host-name you select since
you cannot easily change it after the installation due to a number of
other configuration files/mysql tables that will depend on it.

-   Screen 5: Setup the network options. Users may select from wired or
    wireless configurations with all the standard options such as
    dynamic IP/static IP, devices, mtu size, etc.

Note: For more of MTU sizes a.k.a jumbo frames, see the Jumbo Frames
article.

-   Screen 6: Setup host options. Choices here include system
    configuration (standalone/frontend/master backend/slave backend).
    Initial resolution (i.e. SDTV or HDTV) and remote configure are also
    on this screen. The setup GUI contains many options for remote
    controls that are preconfigured for you. Users also set the option
    to use or not use mythwelcome on this screen.

Note: Make sure you understand the architecture of mythtv networks. A
selection of standalone should only be made if this is and will be the
only mythtv box on your network. For more on this, see [insertlink this]
page on the official mythtv wiki.

-   Screen 7: Setup timezone/zipcode

-   Screen 8: Setup NFS options if media is stored on a remote NFS
    share. Also configure automatic updates

-   Screen 9: Setup user accounts and passwords

Warning: Make sure to create a non-mythtv account, assign a root
password and assign a mythtv password on this screen before you
continue. Under R6.02.00 and higher, the screen is lacking, passwords
and user creation shall be managed later through CLI.

-   Screen 10: Sanity check/"Are you sure you wish to continue?" screen.

This concludes the installation. The scripts will take over and in about
5 min you will reboot into your LinHES installation.
