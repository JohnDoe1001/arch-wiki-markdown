User-mode-Linux (UML) is a method to run Linux inside Linux as a normal
process. Please check [1] for in-depth information what UML is and how
it works.

Why use UML?
------------

Running UML is a safe way to run multiple instances of (Arch-)Linux at
the same time. The single processes are separated from each other, which
makes it secure to run, for example, a testing instance and a production
instance on the same machine. If something goes wrong inside the testing
instance, it does not interfere with the host Linux or the productive
instance.

HOWTO
-----

There are two methods:

-   Use hostfs with vde2 network (all UMLs use same file system)
-   Use rootfs with tap network (require build image)

Both methods are workable on Linux 3.4.4-3 (Jul 3 2012)

> Setup by hostfs + vde2

Hostfs means use the host's file system in read-only mode.

Required packages

-   AUR package: linux-usermode
-   Utility packages: vde2 screen start-stop-daemon rsyslog

Launch script

-   download http://pastebin.com/qDE0D7Lk script as 2vm.bash
-   use normal user to launch 2vm.bash (there are two VMs named as 'C1'
    & 'C2')
-   modify the 2vm.bash to fit your requirements

> Setup by rootfs + tap

Required packages

-   AUR package: linux-usermode
-   Utility packages: vde2 uml_utilities_tunpatch

Build rootfs image

1.) First you have to create a single, big file into which you will
install Arch Linux. This command creates a single 1 GB file, only
containing zeros, which should be enough for a basic Arch Linux
installation.

    dd if=/dev/zero of=rootfs bs=1MB count=1000

or

    fallocate -l 1GB ./rootfs

2.) After the build process you have to format the root file system
image:

    mke2fs -F rootfs

3.) After formatting the file, you have to mount it. Executing the
following command as root does the job (you have also to load the loop
module with modprobe):

    mount -o loop rootfs /mnt

4.) Now the installation of the basic system may start:

    mkdir -p /mnt/var/lib/pacman
    pacman -Sy base -r /mnt
    cd /mnt/dev
    mknod --mode=660 ubd0 b 98 0
    chown root:disk ubd0

5.) Before the system can be booted with user-mode-Linux, some files
inside the Arch basic system have to be customised. Add this line to
/mnt/etc/fstab:

    /dev/ubd0 / ext2 defaults 0 0

                           Reason: /etc/rc.conf has 
                           been obsoleted for a     
                           long time. Needs to be   
                           updated for systemd.     
                           (Discuss)                
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

To avoid long boot time you are advised to disable hotplugin in
/mnt/etc/rc.conf:

    DAEMONS=(..Â !hotplugin ..)

6.) Now unmount the file system.

Warning:If you change anything inside your mounted file system (e.g.
/mnt) while it is running, it may lead to significant file system
corruption inside your virtual machine and kill it!

    umount /mnt

7.) Next step is to set up networking. Therefore, you create a so called
tun device (Please visit the UML how-to for further information about
tun/tap), and give it an IP address. The following lines load the
necessary tun module, create a tun/tap device that is readable by the
users group, and sets it up with the given IP address. For security, you
should consider creating a certain UML group with read permissions for
the network device.

    modprobe tun
    tunctl -g users
    chown root.users /dev/net/tun
    ip addr add 192.168.0.100/24 dev tap0

8.) Now you can boot the image. To use the network, you have to announce
the proper device to the UML kernel. (Mind that the user running the UML
command needs enough rights to access the tun device!)

    vmlinux ubd0=rootfs eth0=tuntap,,,192.168.0.100

The ,,, means:

    eth0=transport,tuntap device,MAC address,ip

Example:

    eth0=tuntap,tap0,3f:2a:bb:00:00:00,192.168.0.100

Headless example:

     vmlinux ubd0=rootfs eth0=tuntap,,,192.168.0.100 mem=128M con=pty
