Kxmame is a KDE port of the GXmame frontend for xmame and sdlmame
emulators.

How to obtain
-------------

Download, build and install the kxmame-svn AUR package.

Steps to follow after installation
----------------------------------

-   Install sdlmame (available in [community]).
-   Start kxmame, click through the first two error messages (regarding
    xmame) and then add "/usr/bin/sdlmame" to the Xmame/Xmess
    executables list.
-   Click OK and then click No when prompted to rebuild the game list.
    After that, close kxmame.
-   Create a "roms" directory inside "~/.mame" and move your roms into
    it.
-   Start kxmame again and select Yes when prompted to rebuild the game
    list.
-   Close the "Audit done" window.

You should now be able to start your roms from within kxmame.
