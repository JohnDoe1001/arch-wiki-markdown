Create a new page and its translation
-------------------------------------

1.  If you do not know how to edit wiki pages, read Help:Editing.
2.  Read Help:i18n, which contains comprehensive guidelines for ArchWiki
    internationalization and localization.
3.  Login to be able to edit the wiki.
4.  Choose a page to translate. You can use the random page function or
    translate a page in the list of priority pages. The non-existent
    page Some Page is used as an example here.
5.  On the page you chose, click edit in the horizontal menu.
6.  Add an interlanguage link for the translation you are going to
    create. (See Help:i18n#Interlanguage links.)
7.  Copy the entire page's source code.
8.  Save the page with the new interlanguage link.
9.  Visit the interlanguage link you have just created which will lead
    you to Some Page (Some Language), where Some Language is the
    language name associated with the translation you are about to
    create.
10. Since the new page does not exist, create it by clicking on create
    in the horizontal menu.
11. You will be shown a simple WYSIWYG editor. Paste the source code of
    the page to be translated here.
12. Change the Category to the localized version. For example, change
    [[Category:Internationalization]] to
    [[Category:Internationalization (Some Language)]]. See Help:Category
    for more info.
13. Change the interlanguage link that you created earlier to point to
    the article from which you are translating.
14. Translate the copied page text and save everything properly.
15. Update the interlanguage lists of all other translations of the
    article (if any) to inculde the interlanguage link of the
    newly-created translation.
16. Create a new ArchWiki page,
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Localized name of translated page,
    whose title is a localized version of Some Page (Some Language).
    Enter #REDIRECT [[Some_Page_(Some Language)]] as its only content.
