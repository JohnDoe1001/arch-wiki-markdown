Summary help replacing me

This article covers many aspects of SSDs (solid state drives) as they
relate to Linux; however, the underlying principles and key learning
presented within are general enough to be applicable to users running
SSDs on other operating systems such as the Windows family of products
as well as Mac OS X. Beyond the aforementioned information, Linux users
will benefit from the tweaks/optimization presented herein.

Overview

> Introduction

Solid State Drives (SSDs) are not PnP devices. Special considerations
such as partition alignment, choice of file system, TRIM support, etc.
are needed to set up SSDs for optimal performance. This article attempts
to capture referenced, key learnings to enable users to get the most out
of SSDs under Linux. Users are encouraged to read this article in its
entirety before acting on recommendations as the content is organized by
topic, not necessarily by any systematic or chronologically relevant
order.

Note:This article is targeted at users running Linux, but much of the
content is also relevant to our friends using other operating systems
like BSD, Mac OS X or Windows.

> Advantages over HDDs

-   Fast read speeds - 2-3x faster than modern desktop HDDs (7,200 RPM
    using SATA2 interface).
-   Sustained read speeds - no decrease in read speed across the
    entirety of the device. HDD performance tapers off as the drive
    heads move from the outer edges to the center of HDD platters.
-   Minimal access time - approximately 100x faster than an HDD. For
    example, 0.1 ms (100 us) vs. 12-20 ms (12,000-20,000 us) for desktop
    HDDs.
-   High degree of reliability.
-   No moving parts.
-   Minimal heat production.
-   Minimal power consumption - fractions of a W at idle and 1-2 W while
    reading/writing vs. 10-30 W for a HDD depending on RPMs.
-   Light-weight - ideal for laptops.

> Limitations

-   Per-storage cost (close to a dollar per GB, vs. around a dime or two
    per GB for rotating media).
-   Capacity of marketed models is lower than that of HDDs.
-   Large cells require different filesystem optimizations than rotating
    media. The flash translation layer hides the raw flash access which
    a modern OS could use to optimize access.
-   Partitions and filesystems need some SSD-specific tuning. Page size
    and erase page size are not autodetected.
-   Cells wear out. Consumer MLC cells at mature 50nm processes can
    handle 10000 writes each; 35nm generally handles 5000 writes, and
    25nm 3000 (smaller being higher density and cheaper). If writes are
    properly spread out, are not too small, and align well with cells,
    this translates into a lifetime write volume for the SSD that is a
    multiple of its capacity. Daily write volumes have to be balanced
    against life expectancy.
-   Firmwares and controllers are complex. They occasionally have bugs.
    Modern ones consume power comparable with HDDs. They implement the
    equivalent of a log-structured filesystem with garbage collection.
    They translate SATA commands traditionally intended for rotating
    media. Some of them do on the fly compression. They spread out
    repeated writes across the entire area of the flash, to prevent
    wearing out some cells prematurely. They also coalesce writes
    together so that small writes are not amplified into as many erase
    cycles of large cells. Finally they move cells containing data so
    that the cell does not lose its contents over time.
-   Performance can drop as the disk gets filled. Garbage collection is
    not universally well implemented, meaning freed space is not always
    collected into entirely free cells.

> Pre-Purchase Considerations

There are several key features to look for prior to purchasing a
contemporary SSD.

-   Native TRIM support is a vital feature that both prolongs SSD
    lifetime and reduces loss of performance for write operations over
    time.
-   Buying the right sized SSD is key. As with all filesystems, target
    <75Â % occupancy for all SSD partitions to ensure efficient use by
    the kernel.

Reviews

This section is not meant to be all-inclusive, but does capture some key
reviews.

Tips for Maximizing SSD Performance
-----------------------------------

> Partition Alignment

Using partitions that are aligned with the erase block size is highly
recommended. In past, this required manual calculation and intervention
when partitioning. Many of the common partition tools handle partition
alignment automatically (assuming users are using an up-to-date
version):

-   fdisk
-   gdisk
-   gparted
-   parted

To verify a partition is aligned, query it using /usr/bin/blockdev as
shown below, if a '0' is returned, the partition is aligned:

    # blockdev --getalignoff /dev/<partition>
    0

> TRIM

Most SSDs support the ATA_TRIM command for sustained long-term
performance and wear-leveling. For more including some before and after
benchmark, see this tutorial.

As of linux kernel version 3.7, the following filesystems support TRIM:
Ext4, Btrfs, JFS, and XFS.

The Choice of Filesystem section of this article offers more details.

Verify TRIM Support

    # hdparm -I /dev/sda |grep TRIM
            *    Data Set Management TRIM supported (limit 1 block)
            *    Deterministic read data after TRIM

To have a better understanding of "limit 1 block" or "limit 8 block",
see wikipedia:TRIM#ATA

Enable TRIM by Mount Flags

Using this flag in one's /etc/fstab enables the benefits of the TRIM
command stated above.

    /dev/sda1  /       ext4   defaults,noatime,discard   0  1
    /dev/sda2  /home   ext4   defaults,noatime,discard   0  2

Note:Using the discard flag for an ext3 root partition will result in it
being mounted read-only.

Warning:Users need to be certain that kernel version 2.6.33 or above is
being used AND that their SSD supports TRIM before attempting to mount a
partition with the discard flag. Data loss can occur otherwise!

Apply TRIM via cron

Enabling TRIM on supported SSDs is definitely recommended. But sometimes
it may cause some SSDs to perform slowly during deletion of files. If
this is the case, one may choose to use fstrim as an alternative.

    # fstrim -v /

The partition for which fstrim is to be applied must be mounted, and
must be indicated by the mount point.

If this method seems like a better alternative, it might be a good idea
to have this run from time to time using cron. To have this run daily,
the default cron package (cronie) includes an anacron implementation
which, by default, is set up for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly
jobs. To add to the list of daily cron tasks, simply create a script
that takes care of the desired actions and put it in /etc/cron.daily,
/etc/cron.weekly, etc. Appropriate nice and ionice values are
recommended if this method is chosen. If implemented, remove the discard
option from /etc/fstab.

Note:Use the discard mount option as a first choice. This method should
be considered second to the normal implementation of TRIM.

Apply TRIM via a systemd service

See this blog post.

Enable TRIM for LVM

Enable issue_discards option in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf.

Enable TRIM With tune2fs (Discouraged)

One can set the trim flag statically with tune2fs:

    # tune2fs -o discard /dev/sdXY

Warning:This method will cause the discard option to not show up with
mount.

> I/O Scheduler

  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
  [Tango-dialog-warning.pn This article or section  [Tango-dialog-warning.pn
  g]                       is out of date.          g]
                           Reason: According to the 
                           discussion page, the CFQ 
                           scheduler can detect     
                           SSDs and modifies its    
                           behavior appropriately,  
                           so there is no need to   
                           change the I/O           
                           scheduler. (Discuss)     
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

Consider switching from the default CFQ scheduler (Completely Fair
Queuing) to NOOP or Deadline. The latter two offer performance boosts
for SSDs. The NOOP scheduler, for example, implements a simple queue for
all incoming I/O requests, without re-ordering and grouping the ones
that are physically closer on the disk. On SSDs seek times are identical
for all sectors, thus invalidating the need to re-order I/O queues based
on them.

The CFQ scheduler is enabled by default on Arch. Verify this by viewing
the contents /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler:

    $ cat /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler

    noop deadline [cfq]

The scheduler currently in use is denoted from the available schedulers
by the brackets.

Users can change this on the fly without the need to reboot with:

    # echo noop > /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler

or:

    $ sudo tee /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler <<< noop

This method is non-persistent (eg. change will be lost upon rebooting).
Confirm the change was made by viewing the contents of the file again
and ensuring "noop" is between brackets.

Kernel parameter (for a single device)

If the sole storage device in the system is an SSD, consider setting the
I/O scheduler for the entire system via the elevator=noop kernel
parameter.

Using the sys virtual filesystem (for multiple devices)

                           using a custom service.  
                           (Discuss)                
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------

This method is preferred when the system has several physical storage
devices (for example an SSD and an HDD).

Create the following tmpfile where X is the letter for the SSD device.

    /etc/tmpfiles.d/set_IO_scheduler.conf 

    w /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler - - - - noop

Because of the potential for udev to assign different /dev/ nodes to
drives before and after a kernel update, users must take care that the
NOOP scheduler is applied to the correct device upon boot. One way to do
this is by using the SSD's device ID to determine its /dev/ node. To do
this automatically, use the following snippet instead of the line above
and add it to /etc/rc.local:

    declare -ar SSDS=(
      'scsi-SATA_SAMSUNG_SSD_PM8_S0NUNEAB861972'
      'ata-SAMSUNG_SSD_PM810_2.5__7mm_256GB_S0NUNEAB861972'
    )

    for SSD in "${SSDS[@]}"Â ; do
      BY_ID=/dev/disk/by-id/$SSD

      if [[ -e $BY_ID ]]Â ; then
        DEV_NAME=`ls -l $BY_ID | awk '{ print $NF }' | sed -e 's/[/\.]//g'`
        SCHED=/sys/block/$DEV_NAME/queue/scheduler

        if [[ -w $SCHED ]]Â ; then
          echo noop > $SCHED
        fi
      fi
    done

where SSDS is a Bash array containing the device IDs of all SSD devices.
Device IDs are listed in /dev/disk/by-id/ as symbolic links pointing to
their corresponding /dev/ nodes. To view the links listed with their
targets, issue the following command:

    $ ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/

Using udev for one device or HDD/SSD mixed environment

Though the above will undoubtedly work, it is probably considered a
reliable workaround. Ergo, it would be preferred to use the system that
is responsible for the devices in the first place to implement the
scheduler. In this case it is udev, and to do this, all one needs is a
simple udev rule.

To do this, create the following:

    /etc/udev/rules.d/60-schedulers.rules

    # set deadline scheduler for non-rotating disks
    ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", TEST!="queue/rotational", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="deadline"
    ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="0", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="deadline"

    # set cfq scheduler for rotating disks
    ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="cfq"

Of course, set Deadline/CFQ to the desired schedulers. Changes should
occur upon next boot. To check success of the new rule:

    $ cat /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler  # where X is the device in question

Note:Keep in mind CFQ is the default scheduler, so the second rule with
the standard kernel is not actually necessary. Also, in the example
sixty is chosen because that is the number udev uses for its own
persistent naming rules. Thus, it would seem that block devices are at
this point able to be modified and this is a safe position for this
particular rule. But the rule can be named anything so long as it ends
in .rules.)

> Swap Space on SSDs

One can place a swap partition on an SSD. Most modern desktops with an
excess of 2 Gigs of memory rarely use swap at all. The notable exception
is systems which make use of the hibernate feature. The following is a
recommended tweak for SSDs using a swap partition that will reduce the
"swappiness" of the system thus avoiding writes to swap:

    # echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

Or one can simply do as recommended in the Maximizing Performance
article:

    /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf

    vm.swappiness=1
    vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

> SSD Memory Cell Clearing

On occasion, users may wish to completely reset an SSD's cells to the
same virgin state they were at the time the device was installed thus
restoring it to its factory default write performance. Write performance
is known to degrade over time even on SSDs with native TRIM support.
TRIM only safeguards against file deletes, not replacements such as an
incremental save.

The reset is easily accomplished in a three step procedure denoted on
the SSD Memory Cell Clearing wiki article.

> Disabling NCQ

Some SSDs do not work properly with Linux Native Command Queueing (NCQ).
The tell-tale dmsg errors look like this:

    [ 9.115544] ata9: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0xf SErr 0x0 action 0x10 frozen
    [ 9.115550] ata9.00: failed command: READ FPDMA QUEUED
    [ 9.115556] ata9.00: cmd 60/04:00:d4:82:85/00:00:1f:00:00/40 tag 0 ncq 2048 in
    [ 9.115557] res 40/00:18:d3:82:85/00:00:1f:00:00/40 Emask 0x4 (timeout)

To disable NCQ, you need to tell the kernel at boot. If you use GRUB,
update the boot flags:

    /etc/defaults/grub

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="libata.force=noncq"

And then rebuild your GRUB config:

    # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Tips for Minimizing SSD Read/Writes
-----------------------------------

An overarching theme for SSD usage should be 'simplicity' in terms of
locating high-read/write operations either in RAM (Random Access Memory)
or on a physical HDD rather than on an SSD. Doing so will add longevity
to an SSD. This is primarily due to the large erase block size (512 KiB
in some cases); a lot of small writes result in huge effective writes.

Note:A 32GB SSD with a mediocre 10x write amplification factor, a
standard 10000 write/erase cycle, and 10GB of data written per day,
would get an 8 years life expectancy. It gets better with bigger SSDs
and modern controllers with less write amplification.

Use $ iotop -oPa and sort by disk writes to see how much programs are
writing to disk.

> Intelligent Partition Scheme

-   For systems with both an SSD and an HDD, consider relocating the
    /var partition to a magnetic disc on the system rather than on the
    SSD itself to avoid read/write wear.

> noatime Mount Flag

Using this flag in one's /etc/fstab halts the logging of read accesses
to the file system via an update to the atime information associated
with the file. The importance of the noatime setting is that it
eliminates the need by the system to make writes to the file system for
files which are simply being read. Since writes can be somewhat
expensive as mentioned in previous section, this can result in
measurable performance gains.

Note:The write time information to a file will continue to be updated
anytime the file is written to with this option enabled.

    /dev/sda1  /       ext4   defaults,noatime   0  1
    /dev/sda2  /home   ext4   defaults,noatime   0  2

Note:This setting will cause issues with some programs such as Mutt, as
the access time of the file will eventually be previous than the
modification time, which would make no sense. Using the relatime option
instead of noatime will ensure that the atime field will never be prior
to the last modification time of a file. Alternatively, using the
maildir storage format also solves this mutt issue.

> Locate High-Use Files to RAM

Browser Profiles

One can easily mount browser profile(s) such as chromium, firefox,
opera, etc. into RAM via tmpfs and also use rsync to keep them synced
with HDD-based backups. In addition to the obvious speed enhancements,
users will also save read/write cycles on their SSD by doing so.

The AUR contains several packages to automate this process, for example
profile-sync-daemon.

Others

For the same reasons a browser's profile can be relocated to RAM, so can
highly used directories such as /srv/http (if running a web server). A
sister project to profile-sync-daemon is anything-sync-daemon, which
allows users to define any directory to sync to RAM using the same
underlying logic and safe guards.

> Compiling in tmpfs

Intentionally compiling in /tmp is a great idea to minimize this
problem. Arch Linux defaults /tmp to 50Â % of the physical memory. For
systems with >4 GB of memory, one can create a /scratch and mount it to
tmpfs set to use more than 50Â % of the physical memory.

Example of a machine with 8 GB of physical memory:

    $ mount | grep tmpfs

    tmpfs     /scratch     tmpfs     nodev,nosuid,size=7G     0     0

> Disabling Journaling on the filesystem

Using a journaling filesystem such as ext4 on an SSD WITHOUT a journal
is an option to decrease read/writes. The obvious drawback of using a
filesystem with journaling disabled is data loss as a result of an
ungraceful dismount (i.e. post power failure, kernel lockup, etc.). With
modern SSDs, Ted Tso advocates that journaling can be enabled with
minimal extraneous read/write cycles under most circumstances:

Amount of data written (in megabytes) on an ext4 file system mounted
with noatime.

operation

journal

w/o journal

percent change

git clone

367.0

353.0

3.81Â %

make

207.6

199.4

3.95Â %

make clean

6.45

3.73

42.17Â %

"What the results show is that metadata-heavy workloads, such as make
clean, do result in almost twice the amount data written to disk. This
is to be expected, since all changes to metadata blocks are first
written to the journal and the journal transaction committed before the
metadata is written to their final location on disk. However, for more
common workloads where we are writing data as well as modifying
filesystem metadata blocks, the difference is much smaller."

Note:The make clean example from the table above typifies the importance
of intentionally doing compiling in tmpfs as recommended in the
preceding section of this article!

Choice of Filesystem
--------------------

> Btrfs

Btrfs support has been included with the mainline 2.6.29 release of the
Linux kernel. Some feel that it is not mature enough for production use
while there are also early adopters of this potential successor to ext4.
Users are encouraged to read the Btrfs article for more info.

> Ext4

Ext4 is another filesystem that has support for SSD. It is considered as
stable since 2.6.28 and is mature enough for daily use. ext4 users must
explicitly enable the TRIM command support using the discard mount
option in fstab (or with tune2fs -o discard /dev/sdaX). See the official
in kernel tree documentation for further information on ext4.

> XFS

Many users do not realize that in addition to ext4 and btrfs, XFS has
TRIM support as well. This can be enabled in the usual ways. That is,
the choice may be made of either using the discard option mentioned
above, or by using the fstrim command. More information can be found on
the XFS wiki.

> JFS

As of Linux kernel version 3.7, proper TRIM support has been added. So
far, there is not a great wealth of information of the topic but it has
certainly been picked up by Linux news sites. It is apparent that it can
be enabled via the discard mount option, or by using the method of batch
TRIMs with fstrim.

> Other filesystems

There are other filesystems specifically designed for SSD. For example
F2fs.

Firmware Updates
----------------

> ADATA

ADATA has a utility available for Linux (i686) on their support page
here. The link to latest firmware will appear after selecting the model.

Latest Linux update utility is packed with firmware and needs to be
runned as root. You might need to set correct permissions for binary
file first.

> Crucial

Crucial provides an option for updating the firmware with an ISO image.
These images can be found after selecting the product here and
downloading the "Manual Boot File." Owners of an M4 Crucial model, may
check if a firmware upgrade is needed with smartctl.

    $ smartctl --all /dev/sdX

    ==> WARNING: This drive may hang after 5184 hours of power-on time:
    http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Crucial-m4-Firmware-BSOD,14544.html
    See the following web pages for firmware updates:
    http://www.crucial.com/support/firmware.aspx
    http://www.micron.com/products/solid-state-storage/client-ssd#software

Users seeing this warning are advised to backup all sensible data and
consider upgrading immediately.

> Kingston

Kingston has a Linux utilty to update the firmware of their Sandforce
based drives. It can be found on their support page.

> Mushkin

The lesser known Mushkin brand Solid State drives also use Sandforce
controllers, and have a Linux utility (nearly identical to Kingston's)
to update the firmware.

> OCZ

OCZ has a command line utility available for Linux (i686 and x86_64) on
their forum here.

> Samsung

Samsung notes that update methods other than by using their Magician
Software is "not supported", but it is possible. Apparently the Magician
Software can be used to make a USB drive bootable with the firmware
update. The easiest method, though, is to use the bootable ISO images
they provide for updating the firmware. They can be grabbed from here.

Note:Samsung does not make it obvious at all that they actually provide
these. They seem to have 4 different firmware update pages each
referencing different ways of doing things.

> SanDisk

SanDisk makes ISO firmware images to allow SSD firmware update on
operating systems that are unsupported by their SanDisk SSD Toolkit. One
must choose the firmware for the right SSD model, as well as for the
capacity that it has (e.g. 60GB, or 256GB). After burning the adequate
ISO firmware image, simply restart the PC to boot with the newly created

a mess IMHO), but here are some relevant links:

SanDisk Extreme SSD Firmware Release notes and Manual Firmware update
version R211

SanDisk Ultra SSD Firmware release notes and Manual Firmware update
version 365A13F0
